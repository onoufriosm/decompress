    "transcript": "They have two conflicting ideas of news [music] which emerge from two different parts of our history. News sort of starts to begin in ancient Rome. They were trying to control rumors. And as bad [music] as we think the internet is, ancient Rome was far worse. In the 1400s [music] along the river Rine is this idea that free speech is necessary for social peace. The Dutch ideas of the Ry River tolerance come here. The upper class of New York is terrified. They fear the accountability of the opinions [music] of people. And what we're seeing playing out with all of these battles on [music] X and on YouTube is these two different ideas are in a death match. depending on [music] which side wins depends on how we will see reality in the coming decades. >> Richard Miner, welcome back to Trigonometry. >> Well, it's great to be back, guys. >> Well, it is great to have you back because the last episode we did with you, the first episode we did with you was on our last US trip. I think it was one of the biggest interviews we've done actually in the history of the channel. Absolutely crushed it. Fantastic conversation about American history. Today we wanted to talk to you about the history of news, history of journalism, the history of censorship and uh there's a lot to talk about going all the way all the way back. >> There is a lot to talk about and a lot of what people when people fight about news which they do on the internet every moment of every day. It's because they have two conflicting ideas of news which emerge from two different parts of our history. And once you understand the history of news, you'll understand why both sides feel so intensely about their point of view. >> And what are those two sides? >> Well, let's do the history first, right? Okay. So, >> as all good histories, let's start with caves and cave drawings, right? >> And the early humans told stories on the walls of caves. And we think due to certain DNA evidence about a 100,000 years ago started telling oral stories. But I would contend while they were passing on new information, they were passing on speculation, emotional reactions to things, um they might even have been telling, you know, recent history, this is how the hunt went or this happened in the village over the hill. That wasn't news. >> Mhm. That was information, speculation, rumor. Just a little aside also, I think scientists misunderstand these cave drawings, these wonderful animals, some of which are extinct and we have no evidence of other than the drawing on uh on the wall of Leco in France or different Spanish caves. But during the ice age, you're spending a lot of days indoors. If I go to any in in the winter time in the northern hemisphere, any person's home that has children and I go into the child's room, what's on the walls? Animals. Pictures of animals. Right? So, isn't it possible that they weren't necessarily leaving a record for us, which they had no idea about, but to entertain their children during the long ice age, >> right? >> So, entertainment is older than news. We knew that already. So this goes on for a while. City states form and governments begin issuing decrees. They make announcements from palace walls and we have records of these from the Sumerianss and the Babylonians and cities of and Lagosh. Um and some of these records are very old for 40,000 35,000 BC. But again that's not news. That is the people in charge telling you what they're doing and maybe not even why or what your orders are. News sort of starts to begin proto news emerges I contend in ancient Rome with the acta derna which you can translate as the daily acts or the public acts. And this isn't yet news but it's very close because it is presented to the general public. It's we don't have any copies of these. These have all vanished. We know the act exists only because of quotations from various Roman writers who we do have copies of their work. But we do know that um these were put up fresh every day for about a 200year period starting in BC and ending uh depending on who what sources you see 180 or 220 uh AD. Uh and they announce far-off victories or defeats. uh sometimes other news gossip that would make the Daily Mail blush. Uh senators, mistresses caught in embarrassing situations, but these are um put up in the forum and in other public places um and then sometimes read aloud to the illiterate kind of like town criers that you'd see much later in history. Uh so it has the mix that we would recognize, right? It has gossip. It has politics. It has a bit of economics. It has foreign affairs. But it's controlled by the government and it is not really accountable publicly. Um the audience doesn't have a say and only senators and tribunes and tribunes there's the Romans were ruled by a two house uh congress or parliament, right? The senators and the tribunes. Uh so the uh the famous abbreviation you see everywhere SPQR uh is the Senate and the people of Rome. Well the people is the house of represented in the house of the tribunes. Anyway, a tribune an elected official or senator another elected official largely inherited as well. They could object. That was it. Um and there were no there's no correction process. You couldn't sue. There was no liel. There was no slander. But it's the beginning of news. Now, why do the Romans do it? No other ancient people had really done it this way before. And it's because they were trying to control rumors and speculation. And as bad as we think the internet is, ancient Rome was far worse, right? People making up all sorts of wild stories, people thinking the conspiracy theories of the internet. Ancient Rome had this times 10. And they realized if we didn't do something, if we didn't start to say like what the actual casualty figures were in the battle that we lost or what the actual territory we just took was, wild stories would abound. And that would mean that there would be trials, sometimes executions, coups, upheavalss, all sorts of things. So, if we could give the public, and this is why it's proto news, a common share of facts, things that we all know are true and can roughly agree on that, that would cause peace. Not perfect peace, not perfect harmony, but at least we're not arguing about basic facts. And that is the beginning of understanding the importance of news. If we all have the same vocabulary of facts, then we're debating about how important this is compared to that. That is it. Why is our politics so polarized today? Because we no longer have this shared diet of facts. >> But when it works and we're all agreed as to what is going on, what the facts are, and the debate is about the emphasis, we're in a much less polarized world. That's why the Romans created the act. That's what they were trying to do. Now, news really begins, and maybe Francis, this differs entirely from what PBS told you, and so I apologize. >> [snorts] >> um about in the 1400s along the river Ry. Now the Rine is a very special river in European history. Uh it begins in the mountains of Switzerland. It goes through Germany and then it empties into the North Sea in uh modern day Netherlands, Holland. And along this river we see a tremendous amount of Protestant movements emerges. Germany at this place at this time period is not a united country even though technically it's the Holy Roman Empire. There's different princes and principalities and dukes and so on. And your royal leader, your princely leader could decide what flavor of Protestant you were or whether you're still with the Roman Catholic Church. And you would be on a boat going down the Rine and you would be, if you were a Protestant, you'd look out on Catholic cities and you know that if you came to shore, the chances of you being tried and burnt alive as a heretic were very high. And yet on the river 10t from shore in the current, you were safe and your cargo was safe for the most part. And that's not to say that all Protestants were united either. Protestants executed Protestants. These religious wars were intense. But just as the Gutenberg in the city of Mes that's sort of on the east bank or the left side of the uh looking from above of the Ryan River almost in the dead middle of the German Rine is Mines. And in that city, not far from the docks, is this guy Gutenberg with the movable type printing presses. There are others who have similar devices, maybe not as good as his, and he's printing the Bible. And he makes so much money printing on them the Bible in the vernacular. He can afford to take um speculation and printing other things. So he prints cataloges, he prints opinions, he prints religious tracts, uh, including for denominations that he doesn't share the values of with the idea that if it even if it's banned in mines, he can bundle it down to the docks, put it on a boat, and the city that's paying for it further down the Rine will take the cargo and he'll make the cash. So as long as he's not caught with it, everything's fine. >> So why is all this matter? Well, it is competition of ideas. And remember in medieval times, all political ideas are really offshoots of religious ideas. And the core Protestant idea at this time is that you have a personal relationship with God. You discover who he is in your personal journey. And you have, to use a horrible modern phrase, your truth. >> Mhm. >> And no one, and by the way, that's where that idea comes from. And no one should be able in the Protestant perspective, no one should be able to interfere in your exploration. And part of your exploration is talking about it and thinking about it and reading about it. So in this great these religious wars and this desire for social peace and just you know you guys go worship over here and we'll worship here and these third guys will go worship over there. is this idea that free speech is necessary for social peace. Let everyone have their say. Let the ideas move up and down the rine about religion, but also increasingly about politics, about economics. And believe it or not, we owe this initial idea of free speech, which is essential to the creation of news, to these very tough-minded German Protestants who were stubbornly insisting they were right and everyone else was wrong. And also their great desire to make money. And capitalism, which is a lot like the individ you have an individual relationship with God, is that you have the right to an individual relationship with your customers and your employees. You can choose who to hire and fire. There are no hereditary employees. It's a it's governed by contract. And you have a right to sell to your customers as they if they choose you and you choose them, that's it. That's all that matters. So this idea of this personal relationship with God has enormous political and economic effects. And at the mouth of the Rine in the modern day Netherlands becomes an incredibly tolerant society, especially after the Spanish leave in the at the end of the 1500s. And this this idea of tolerance becomes super important. But what is moving up and down isn't just books. People don't want books are expensive and people don't have time for books all the time. but the beginnings of newspapers, what originally called in German news books, but just what's going on in these different cities of the R. And by the way, has the religion of this city changed since you last sailed past and is now unsafe to land or do we want to mock these people in Geneva or in uh Strawborg or what have you? And so these newspapers are quite lively. They caricature people. They make sexual and spiritual allegations. Uh it's as wild as anything on the internet today. And you combine this idea of free speech and capitalism and you get the beginning of news where you have news outlets that are only accountable to the people who pay for them. If you start writing about things that people don't trust, don't believe, your audience goes down and soon your printing costs are higher than your revenue and you're out of business. If on the other hand you you feed your audience, you you give them what they want and hopefully give them a healthy version of what they want um your revenues will grow. More people will buy your paper and this is the beginning of news independent of the state, lively in its perspective, accountable to its readers and this idea evolves and changes over time. It comes to England in Europe almost last, but it it it definitely flowers in the early 1600s in the in the Netherlands and in Germany. And the Dutch settle and form a colony that they call New Amsterdam, which is the modern city of New York. The Dutch ideas of the Ry River tolerance come here. And New York has been a decidedly wide openen free market of ideas, opinions, and businesses for centuries as a result of the Dutch foundations of this city. And [clears throat] by the way, Canal Street in downtown literally was a canal until they f filled it in. I mean the Dutch deep foundations of our culture are hidden but still visible especially in things like what is news and in the 1730s there's a German immigrant from the Rhineland named John Peter Zanger [clears throat] and after apprenticing for a um for a printer in Philadelphia he moves to New York with his wife and opens a small newspaper called the New York Journal and he begins [clears throat] publishing the news of the day and he publishes an account which he says is true of the royal governor of New York. Remember the Brits still rule in the 1730s still rule New York and about corruption, self-deing uh failure to look after the public uh his public duties. um what he has to say about the governor is less important than what happens next. The the governor cannot under British law directly jail him unless he accuses him of a crime and liel is a crime with a uh which you can be in prison for in this time. So, he's imprisoned and held um for 8 months before trial, which is why the one of the reasons why cases like this is why uh you have a right to be arraigned in a very specific amount of time under the US Constitution to this day uh and why you have the right to a jury trial and so on. So if you're imprisoned, you your food in the 1730s in New York this time has to be brought to you by your wife or friends of yours. Someone has to bring you food every day. The prison doesn't necessarily feed you. So his wife would put out the newspaper because that's how they made the money to pay for the food and pay the rent. And uh they keep trying to shut down her newspaper and she works and she would go to jail every night and provide the food to her husband and he would say, \"Okay, go over to New Jersey, take this rowboat over.\" And you know, all these little machinations to stay in business, >> right? Much later, the New York Journal is merged into a newspaper that you may have heard of called the New York Post. Mhm. >> Uh after many changes of ownership and and splits in ownership. Anyway, so uh and copies of this paper exist to this day. You can find faximiles online. He finally goes to trial and some slick lawyers from Pennsylvania argue for the first time in the English common law that truth is a defense against liel. Yes, we do not argue that these things, these facts that we presented make the governor uh open to ridicule. He looks ridiculous. He looks corrupt. But this is the truth. And truth I should not be punished for producing the truth. This is a revolutionary doctrine. And because this is a British Empire case, this precedent will change the English-sp speakaking world. This German immigrant who's been in the United States, thei the colonies really for less than a decade is about to change the English-speaking world. But the governor and the upper class of New York, which is a piece of the upper class of England, is terrified. How will we stop ridicule that will come from the lower classes? How will we stop the fingerpointing? How dare they? What? Our honor comes from status. And our status comes from not being ridiculous. And when Quakers from Pennsylvania tell us that we're going to be made ridiculous, what to do? And their answer is don't do ridiculous things. That's not satisfactory. We are. >> We are important people. They fear the accountability of the opinions of people who are far poorer, far less educated, some cases literally dirtier than themselves. Right? But it's the beginning of a revolution because the jury nullifies. The jury refuses to find him guilty even though the facts say that he is and then he admits that he is more or less at trial. So this becomes a principle. The truth is a defense against liel. Much later in English history, you're going to have some unfortunate laws. And so you can't you if you're if you're trying to operate a newspaper in England today, I would not use the Zanger precedent. But in US law, it is absolutely still governance. Truth is an absolute defense in this country against Lapel. And that case could only have happened in New York where Jilly settled as New Amsterdam with the Dutch sense and the Quaker sense of which comes from the Pennians who argued this in court. And this defense means that you cannot be ruined by the powerful for reporting things about them. which means that suddenly journalists can hold corporations, aristocrats, the famous accountable in a way they never could before. I'm about to share one of those ideas that once you understand it changes how you think about owning gold entirely. This is not a normal gold advert. Today's sponsor is Monetary Metals. And what they're doing is rethinking how gold is used. Traditionally, gold ownership is passive. You buy gold, store it, and hope it preserves value over time. And while it sits there, it doesn't do anything. And often, you're paying storage or insurance fees just to hold it. Monetary Metals approaches gold differently. They allow gold owners to earn a yield on their gold paid in gold, not in dollars or pounds, but in physical gold ounces. The way this works is straightforward. Monetary Metals connects gold owners with real productive businesses like refiners and jewelers that need gold to operate their businesses. Those businesses lease the gold and pay a yield back to the gold owner in gold. That means your gold isn't just sitting idle. It's being put to productive use. And over time, you're earning more ounces of gold. You can earn up to 4% annual yield paid in gold, allowing your holdings to compound in ounces rather than currency. While your gold is earning yield, there are no storage or insurance fees charged, and you remain in control. You decide how much of your gold you want to deploy into lease opportunities and how much you want to keep undeployed. You can open an account with as little as 10 ounces of gold and start earning yield straight away. In an environment where paper currencies lose purchasing power over time, earning a yield in gold is a way of growing real wealth in real terms.

That site again is monetary-metals.com/trigonometry. >> Then the next piece of the revolution happens when you start to apply the factory model of production to news. What could what instead of having to hand print out on something a little bit better than what Gutenberg offered 300 years before just 50 60 years after Zanger, you have these massive printing presses which become ever more efficient at the end of the 18th century and deep into the 19th century. Whereas suddenly by the 1830s you have the penny press, an entire broad sheet, some cases 52 inches wide with pages upon pages, all available for a penny in the US and they are so profitable they're employing people to translate news from overseas and this is where the word correspondent comes from. So in this time period traveling was a very big deal. Most people did not travel far. Now, today we have, you know, jetplanes and uh, you know, 19-year-old illiterates Instagramming from Bali, right? Okay, it's a different world. But in 1791, chances that you could travel more than a dozen miles, two dozen miles, to this day, I think to join the travelers club in uh London in Pel, uh you have to say that you've traveled 400 miles uh from your uh from the the founding stone of the club, right? So even a a trip across the channel to Calala, which a lot of people tried to do that joined the club back in the day, >> uh didn't count. You had to go far a field and 400 miles was considered to be this enormous distance. So our correspondent would be someone from this community who traveled and wrote a letter home. And these letters would be reprinted in the newspaper like this is what I saw in Paris. This is what I saw in Amsterdam or Hong Kong or Shanghai. Um, and they would often print, you know, who the letter was addressed to, and he didn't like, I hope Sally's okay, like that would show up in the piece, right? These were very homespun kind of things originally, but with the mass printing, uh, they begin to think about employing their own correspondence. And the next bit of the revolution comes with the telegraph. The telegraph is the closest thing to the internet that the 19th century has because the telegraph means that you can send a large amount of information almost instantly over an incredible distance. Stock prices can move from London to New York across the Atlantic. Um, and this this business still influences how our news is gathered to this day. Reutder, I think Julius Reutder, if I'm getting his name right, >> notices that there's a gap in the telegraph lines in Belgium, >> and he uses carrier pigeons to move the news for stock trading and and other business news purposes. And from the money from that and various other ventures, he eventually opens a a newswire that uses telegraph lines to move news uh gather news from around the world and and sell it to newspapers in uh famously the Times of London refuses to be his customer for several years and he keeps getting scoop after scoop uh and eventually they bow and become a customer and these businesses become quite large Reuters in London, uh the Associated Press forms in the 1840s in the United States, the Germans, the French, uh and the Spanish all and the Italians all form their news wires, but theirs are different. In the English- speakaking world, these are for-profit ventures that are accountable to their customers. They're doing news part of news is being accountable, letting your audience have a say. And how much do we trust you? Do we believe you? because if we don't believe you, you're not valuable, right? You're you're just just like a government agency issuing edicts. Like it's just not interesting. >> Whereas in in Germany and France, Spain, and Italy, these were government entities more or less from the beginning. And though they mimicked a lot of the freewheeling style of the English language newswires and they did collect information from around the world and frankly some of them have very good product Deutscheella Alons France Press but there's still especially in the beginning in the in the telegraph era in the latter half of the 19th century those governments had a lot of control over what was presented and wasn't but speaking world it was more wide open it's not to say the government didn't censor troop movements and a handful of other things, but for the most part, it was pretty freewheeling. It was pretty wide open. All that's great. By the end of the 19th century, we're gathering news from all over the world. We're reporting it quickly. Competition is improving things, and we have something like uh an honest news system. That's not to say there weren't political party papers, because of course there were. Um, you know, to this day, I think uh there is a uh the Hartford uh it's not the Hartford Current. There's a there's a newspaper in uh in Connecticut named the whatever the name of the town is, the Republican. There's the Arkansas Democrat, right? The political parties used to sponsor their own newspapers and decidedly their own point of view. Uh but the but they were still governed by independent competitors and they knew their readers would be reading those too. So they couldn't go too far. >> Competition, accountability, and this idea that yes, you can have your own individual idea of the truth just like the medieval Protestant could have his own individual relationship with God, but you're in competition. So you got to pay attention to the other people's idea of truth. And so it isn't just your truth. It has to be a shared provable truth. >> Then two things happen and this is why we have such fights over news today. One is a group of intellectuals decide and we could loosely call them the progressives. I'm not making a point about today's progressives. This is what these people at this time call themselves. Which time are we talking about? >> Uh, so sorry. Um, let's say 1890 to 1900. The muckreers emerge just after that. Um, and they do some fabulous reporting on the evil things that happen in meatacking plants and so on. Um, a little bit later by 1920, Walter Litman writes a a fantastic book called uh public opinion and they are criticizing the news as being too slavishly devoted to the audience, right? To put it in British terms, too much like the Daily Mail and not enough like the New York Times, right? >> Um, by the way, much later, the New York Times is founded as a Republican newspaper initially. Funny how things start out. So these progressives want to change the news. The news should not be what the public wants to consume, right? Because from the public's point of view, you consume news for entertainment reasons and to help you make decisions. Who do you vote for? Where do you send your kids to school? Is this a safe neighborhood to build a house in, to buy a house in, etc., etc. to make decisions. And you don't necessarily expect the media to tell you what your values are. You want to find those out on your own. But there are a great number of intellectuals of this time period who want to tell you what your values are. And they come out of the continental European idea of news. And a great number of the early progressives actually studied in um the socialist precincts of Germany in the late 19th century for longer or shorter periods. Um and they're bringing these ideas with them. This whole freewheeling anything can happen as as long as we can prove it, we can report it. That whole ethos has to go away and this needs to be calmed down and governed and run by adults. And look, their criticisms are basically correct. I mean, the newspapers were pretty wild. They would say, you know, pretty, you know, pretty outrageous things. Um, so it did they need to be professionalized and reigned in a bit? Yes. But what they wanted to design was far more than that. They wanted to design a German French model in which what the media reported and what the governing class wanted was the same. >> So what they wanted was to reverse the decision that embarrassed the royal governor of New York in 1735. 200 years later they wanted a doover and we the great and the good should be safe from your ridicule, from your jokes. and they were going to construct a system to do exactly that. So at first they tried a frontal assault and they uh started u they they they [clears throat] made friends with a very interesting character called SS Mccclure and he starts publishing these long form magazines and they would publish literally 10,000word articles on very you know wheat production and things of this nature and no one read those or very few people read those and so as a commercial venture Mccclure wasn't doing so magazine is the famous progressive magazine at this time but there are others right >> uh so we're we're in 1906 1908 here and they start going after um they start doing what FDR would call trustbusting uh they go after Rockefeller and the the other uh robber barons and um they start to realize that these long dense articles aren't going to work but they still want to change societ they still want to change the media. So they pull back and they think about the problem and this is where we see the beginning of a century of changes that give us the kind of news that make us entirely unhappy today. >> So first they begin with awards. Let's reward people not just financially because what the financial rewards are always going to line up with what the readers want. We need to be able to reward people for things that we want. So they invent the pulit surprise. They invent journalism schools. These are the correct people to be journalists. It's not you. By the way, at this period of time, yes, there are some college people who write for newspapers from the beginning, but most of these most of these are bluecollar observers of real life, >> right? So they're they've been sailors and printers and warehouse guys and so they're they're not as susceptible to ideology and they're very immersed in the real world, right? So like wait, you want to do what? You want to open up asylums and let those people live on our streets and that doesn't sound like a good idea, [laughter] right? What are you thinking? Right? What could go wrong? um those kind of people are not congenial for the progressive cause in 1906. >> So in 1908 they uh formed the first journalism school in the United States which is in Missouri. In 1912, you get uh the Columbia School of Journalism, which later awards the Pulitzer Prize, >> and they start to distinguish this is the professional man who went to you know this law school for lawyers and uh by the way there wasn't always before that this the four ends of court in your country. So just as they took the casualness of the training of lawyers and professionalized it in a German way, they did the same thing in journalism. Now in law ar that's a more arguable thing that probably makes sense. With journalism it definitely does not because you get a very particular class and a very particular point of view instead of very a newsroom full of competing classes and some are immigrants and some people were born here you know before the revolution and it's just a constant rolling debate and observation about society. Newsrooms used to be really fun wild places. Uh when I joined the Wall Street Journal uh back in 2000, one of the things the HR department made me sign was a document saying I would not keep a bottle of liquor in the office. And that's probably because decades before this was actually a problem in other news. >> Okay. So they start to professionalize, they start to hand out awards and then they realize what they really need is unions. M >> if they can control the means of production, they control what is produced. >> Problem is the journalists don't like unions. >> And there is a battle between 1908 and 1933 to unionize. And most of these people simply do not just like school teachers in this period of time rejected all attempts at unionization. And in 19 I think it's 1908 uh or shortly thereafter the LA Times is bombed by unions for refusing to unionize. The building explodes. Several people are injured. I think one or two are killed. And it made worldwide news. Right. This half a city block was burnt or or damaged by the explosion. And if the dynamite had been placed slightly better, the death would have deaths would have been far more numerous. Um and ultimately the Justice Department investigates and discovers a ring of bombers associated with the unions and this did not help unions appeal. Um the journalists wanted to be free to write what they saw, what they heard, what they felt, what they thought. Uh doesn't mean these people were saints, but that's what they wanted. They wanted that freedom of movement. and the unions wanted a more formalized controlled structure. And these early violent acts actually slowed down their repeal. But by 1933 they had their first major newspaper unionized. And between the 1930s under the New Deal in the United States and by the early 60s they had basically unionized all television, all radio and all the major newspapers in the United States. And of course the news wires, the Associated Press and Reuters were unionized this time all under the same union. So now you have a cartel. Ultimately this union fractures and there's a couple of major news unions but the News Guild of America was the dominant union at this time. And with unionization comes resistance to change and certain habits of mind which don't like disscent. It's disscent is not good for being in charge of a cartel. Right? [laughter] Toxic in fact. Um, and this starts to drive out of journalism the people who the oddballs, the in both the innovators, the strange people, the people who, you know, will camp out and go after a story when everyone else thinks there's no story there. >> Um, the creative uh, and the self-destructive, right, which often could be the same person. and you you [clears throat] left in its place is a lot of middle class people looking for a safe predictable job. This changes what kind of journalism is produced. I'm not saying that great journalism wasn't produced in this period 30s to the 60s and even after the 60s cuz that would be absolutely false. There are some of the most amazing reporting writing investigations were in the '60s '7s and ' 80s. So I'm not casting aspersions. I'm just saying the kind of person who went into the news. >> Universities are a bad deal. Six figures of debt for a bachelor's degree that signals less every year. Four years spent navigating ideological rules instead of learning how to think. Grades are inflated. Standards are lowered and descent is punished. We call it higher education, but it's mostly expensive daycare with a credential attached. University of Austin, also known as UATX, is different. Admissions at UATX are based on test scores alone. No essays, no resumes, nobody cares who your parents know. If you're smart enough, you're in. UATX students turned down Chicago and fled Barard to complete a demanding great books core, including Aristotle, Shakespeareville alongside real math, science, economics, and AI. Classes are small. Professors actually know your name. Grades aren't padded. Excellence is measured and rewarded. From day one, students work directly with top founders, investors, and institutions, building companies, doing serious research, and landing real internships. And here's the part that changes everything. There is no tuition. Thanks to private donors, every UATX student graduates debtree, free to take risks, start companies, and build a life instead of paying off loans. If you want a credential, look elsewhere. If you want a serious education that actually prepares you to lead, apply to the University of Austin. Visit austin.org. That's austin.org. But the progressives, even after all of this, they've created journalism schools. They've set up uh professional associations like the Society of Professional Journalists to issue ethics rules. They have awards. They have unions. they still don't feel like they have control over this crazy uh beast that is the media. So they start to push for public ownership. In the late 1940s we get um publiclyowned stations, radio stations in San Francisco, New York, LA, and a few other places. Ultimately in the60s we see the emergence of national public radio and public broadcasting which is the television arm. uh and it's like let me show you guys how it should be done is basically the approach of public media to try to condition um the private market from being too going off leaving the catechism, right? Um and then we also see the emergence of the media critic, the person who criticizes media coverage and basically taps everyone back into line. Um, this starts roughly with Walter Litman, but it really takes off in the 1950s and by the 1970s, a lot of places have media critics, and people, journalists live in fear of being criticized by the media critic. And so if you look at what they're doing, they're creating more and more institutional strengths to try to drive the media in one direction to tamp down disscent to be the anti-in to the greatest extent possible. And in the course of doing this, they're actually producing a very different kind of news than what I originally described. They're they want to write the orthodox official opinion. And we see the climax of this in co. How dare you report on dissenting views? How dare you cover um Ivormectton? How dare you say this? How dare you say that? Well, there is no how dare you in journalism. If it's true, report it. If it's not true, say someone's spreading a lie and prove that, >> right? But there's no you're not without fear or favor is the New York Times's famous saying back in the day. What about that? It's great standard and the and reality is incredibly complex and everchanging. To think that it always that the orthodoxy of the people in charge always comports a reality is just a childish point of view. >> Of course it doesn't. What's really cool is not to be a prosecutor to defend and punish uh what the the officials think is right and wrong, but to be a detective, not a prosecutor. Think what's really going on? Why are all why these people think this and are doing this while these other people are be a detective? That's the original idea of news. So, what we have here are two different ideas of news which have been with us since ancient days. which we thought we banished in the 1735 Zanger case but are very much with us today. An official establishment view that is frozen and is negotiated within itself unaccountable to the general public or a form of news that is constantly curious that holds its ideas very lightly because other evidence might emerge. they might have to release those ideas >> that understands that the world is complex and different and variegated and therefore fascinating two different ideas of news and what we're seeing playing out with all of these uh battles at the uh on X and on YouTube is these two different ideas are in a death match in a duel and only one can win and depending on which side wins depends on how we will see reality in the coming decades. Will it be dictated by the professionals, the experts, the people who know better or will it be wild and woolly and unpredictable and fun? >> Well, one that's fascinating by the way, 40minute analysis of the history of this is why we love you. This is fantastic. Um, >> so much to pick up on there. The first and obvious thing to me is you haven't said anything so far about the funding model and that must change at some point as well because if I am in the Gutenberg era I am selling a newspaper or a proto newspaper to the audience to to the person who's going to buy it. if I'm running a t I was uh just miraculously in in a TV channel uh studio this morning not to do something to have a coffee with somebody and while I was waiting I watched you know they have like a 10 screen screen with different TV channels on it while I sat there waiting for my meeting within five 15 minutes I probably saw about 20 ads for healthcare of various kinds for for a big pharma company the entire business is basically run so when you come back to co you're going that is not an accident that they were pushing a particular narrative on it because the entire business model at this point is dependent on the advertisers who dictate to them what they ought to believe and that's something that I think is probably worth delving into as well the funding model of of the business >> okay so I don't think there are advertisers like I know the network news is full of like incontinence ads and things for old people right but why it's not because those people run the news. I I'm I would be shocked to learn that Bayer or Merc or Fizer actually says to the anchors of, you know, the evening news, don't do this story or do this story. I that would be shocking to me. >> Well, they don't need to. >> But but those advertisers are there because that's who the audience is, >> right? If you were selling things that were of interest to young people, it would not be a good investment because there's virtually no one under 40. watching those programs. >> Uh, in fact, getting information from broadcast television is something that younger people just don't do in any appreciable numbers. >> Yeah. >> So, and it's I loved again loved the opening of the interview was so rich and so informative. And what I think I would love to talk to you about is a role between news and censorship because I was reading and push back if this is wrong and PBS were giving me fake news as it were. But I I was reading that particularly in Spain and Britain that censorship the moment the Gutenberg press started to be used, the moment it was used to challenge authority was the moment the authorities basically crown and church went I think we need to take a hold of this. >> Absolutely right. Um, and I think the is it Tinddale is the first translator of major translator of the Bible into English. And I think he's burnt alive outside the walls of Oxford in 1557, something like this. Um, yeah, these people paid with their lives. But they were a very hearty and determined lot. And they kept insisting on their right to tell people about their encounter with God and their views thereby which were heterodox. >> And the more that society, the state tried to stamp down on them, the more people who didn't share their views developed some sympathy for them, >> right? like and also it made people question things that had not been questioned before. And this is hard for us to fully imagine because we are living in a post relligious world especially among educated people. But religion was a deadly serious subject in this in the 16 17 1800s. And the idea that your baptism might be illegitimate and then you might therefore not be saved and therefore your death might be meaningless and you might just disappear when you die was horrifying >> because if your death is meaningless in this time period your life is meaningless and if you take away someone's meaning >> you might as well have ripped out their spine they have no so This these were highly fraught issues and the idea that because it's such an important and personal issue, you as a matter of conscience have the right to explore your connection to the divine and therefore your connection to the real world as well. And I'm not saying the divine world isn't real. I'm saying the ordinary world, the world we see here now, >> that's an extension of this core thing. But in a society that takes religion deeply seriously, the right to pursue and figure this out on your own, as long as you're not harming other people, right? If you are [clears throat] bringing children into dangerous activities that end up in their disfigurement or dismemberment, or you're compelling people not to pay taxes to the king, or things of that defy courts. these kinds of things were not tolerated and the public largely went along with the king stamping down on that stuff. >> But if it was just a bunch of people sitting in a room singing songs out of key, >> the the public support for this was quite low. And one of the great aspects of the English Constitution at this period, we're talking in the 1600s uh before Cromwell, the king had to enforce his will through sheriffs. And every county had a sheriff at this point. And the sheriffs would often refuse to do it. They would refuse to collect taxes if they thought the taxes were unjust. Uh they would refuse to imprison people for like what these people are doing is harmless. You know, I don't like their music. I don't like their view of of the Bible, but oh my gosh, they're just sitting inside on a dreary winter day like doing their thing. What why do I care, right? Sheriff just wouldn't do it. >> [snorts] >> Um, and the king's ministers knew this and they tried there's his correspondence. So, they're trying to figure out how to how to get these sheriffs to actually enforce the king's censorship. But also, the idea that censorship is a bad idea ultimately came to be embraced by Catholics because it was used against them. The censorship was used against them. But initially, this was a deeply deeply Protestant idea. By the way, censorship always fails in the long run. What's tempting about it is it seems to work in the short run. >> So let's look at VHimar Germany 1920s, right? Hyperinflation jazz age. You you've got this in your mind now, right? We've all seen the miniseries. >> The Social Democratic Party, which the SPD still in German, major force in German politics today. It was the ruling party throughout most of the 1920s. And it was worried about the Nazi party, its main rival. Uh and it it it had increasing amounts of censorship, banning books, banning magazines, banning public gatherings, this and all of it drove actual support for these dangerous evil lunatics, the Nazis. And then in 1933, through a series of unfortunate events, Hitler ends up as chancellor of Germany and takes all those censorship laws and applies them to this to the people who put them in place in the first place. the so the social democrats [snorts] and there's a famous incident in the fall of 1933 where they they cry out in in the Reichto and say uh this is wrong. You're violating our our rights. You're censoring us. >> And Hitler said is a very cold voice. I would have much more sympathy for you and your free speech rights if you hadn't been taken hours away for the previous 10 years. and the Hitler supporters and others applaud Hitler's cold, calculating voice. So, this is where censorship leads. It's ultimately used indiscriminately against everyone. It's a very dangerous game. What we're seeing in this Trump hatred today is, >> oh my gosh, you're you're using the laws against me, but I'm one of the good people, right? And there are those of us who believe in limited government who say, be very very careful of the laws you write >> because there you're not going to be in charge forever. And those laws will still be there. >> Write rules that you can live with when you're not in charge. >> And it's such a good point. And yet at the same time I do have empathy for platforms like YouTube during the pandemic where you had conspiracy theories like David Ike going 4G causing COVID for example which we all know to be ludicrous apart from a very sizable minority of people some of whom burnt down 4G towers or destroyed them or whatever else and people will go to the the execs at YouTube and going well this is your fault how did you allow this to happen? Yes. Um, look, there are people the the audience for censorship is quite large and well educated and wellplaced. >> Mhm. >> And they will not just say what you're saying cuz that's kind of reasonable. Like can we really uh push people to commit violent acts and destroy property? Is that like a good thing? Right. Surely that's actually illegal in many cases. M >> but you can't always get rid of the content that you don't like with such, you know, not everyone's appealing to violence, right? Or property destruction. >> So they use copyright strikes. Oh, this person misused this, >> you know, he has 3 seconds of a song and he doesn't own a license to that song or he's got this photograph. Well, he put it on the screen for a second to illustrate his point. Like, but there's no good, at least in the US, no good definition of fair use. And so they'll use copyright strikes to take down unpopular people uh or their claim uh that the that [clears throat] they have stolen intellectual property. You know this he's copying me. I had this out first. >> All that kind of thing. Uh so they will be very legalistic and formulistic in taking down these things. I've always wondered why we've decided that the moderation has to be done at a central point and if the moderation isn't perfect, the company that own that pays the moderators is somehow um at fault. Instead, why doesn't every user get a dashboard and say, \"Okay, I don't want to see any teenage nudity. I don't want to see any hear any swear words.\" And you turn the dials, right? Some For all the stuff we hate seeing on our screens or we don't want our kids to see on their screens, there are other people who love it. >> Most days for us are jam-packed. Meetings, shoots, research, script reviews, everything happening at once. Honestly, half the time I used to just skip meals and then crash a couple of hours later. That's why I started using this high protein starter kit from Hule. It's five black edition ready to drinks plus the black edition chocolate powder. And it's honestly the first thing that's made it easy for me to stay consistent. And by the way, Hugh just launched in Target nationwide. So you can actually grab the ready to drink bottles straight off the shelf right now, which makes life a lot easier. So here's how I use the bundle. On days I'm running out of the door, heading to the studio, to the gym, I just grab a Black Edition ready to drink. It's a complete meal. 35 g of protein, 27 essential minerals and vitamins, no artificial sweeteners, and it actually tastes good. Plus, it's surprisingly filling for something you don't have to prep. Then, on days when I'm home or I want something thicker or cold or just a little more customizable, I use a black edition powder. Sometimes I make a whole smoothie, sometimes I just shake it with water. It still hits that protein goal I'm aiming for. Having both the ready to drink and the powder in my kitchen keeps me from falling off my routine. Honestly, it just makes hitting your protein goals a lot less stressful.

That site again is hu.com/trigger2020. Well, that is a really great point and I think that it would be great if these platforms did move to that kind of model. This isn't a conversation we >> because let me just say one thing. A lot of this is bad faith, right? Oh, this content is so offensive. [clears throat] >> No, actually, it's just challenging your point of view. >> Well, totally agree. And this is what I was going to bring up the example. I don't know if you saw our interview with the uh the CEO of the Center for Counting Digital Hay Imran A. >> Great name, isn't it? Imran Ahmed, who who did turn out to be a bit of a nutter. Um but the one of the questions I said to him and this is I think where it really is not as simple as I think you're saying for for the following reason. I said to him look do you think it should be allowed to call for an armed revolution on social media? And she was like, \"No, do you?\" And I was like, \"Well, I don't know, but what I'm saying is this country wouldn't exist if people were not allowed to call for an armed revolution on the equivalent of social media of their time. The United States would not exist, right?\" >> Well, there were people arrested for sedition against the king, >> right? But but that's what that's exactly what I'm saying though. If you think about it in the modern context though, I think you'd probably find that the overwhelming majority of the public would be like, \"We don't want a civil war caused by people saying these things online.\" >> Do you see Do you see what I'm getting? >> The the re what they call it the risk of real world harm. >> Yes. But what we really don't want is these people deciding that these people shouldn't be allowed to say things which aren't really calling for violent revolution, but these people are pretending that it does. >> Totally. >> Just to disrupt a point of view they don't like. >> Of course. And and that has happened to a ridiculous disgusting level over the last 10 years in particular. There's no question about that. But is it really as simple as saying there should there is never a case of restricting what people say online even when there is a credible risk of real world violence. >> We don't have to reinvent this. Okay. The English common law has been looking at this problem for roughly a thousand years. There's a ton of, you know, real world collisions of interests that have produced cases and decisions >> and we just have to return to these very common sense ideas, >> right? So, we can't have people marketing things as food that are in fact poison and people die, right? >> We, you know, there are you the classic example about shouting fire in a crowded theater. >> Um, it doesn't mean that everything you say has to be provably true. some to some of your freedom of speech is the right to freely speculate, right? >> I think AI will be the end of the world. I think AI will be the greatest thing. Well, you know, as Yoda likes to say, always in motion as the future, right? Like it's hard to know. It hasn't happened yet, right? So, people should be there should be freedom of speculation. Uh you shouldn't be able to hold yourself out as something that you're not. You say, \"Trust me, I'm a doctor. This is perfectly safe.\" Well, hang on. you know, you you you did one semester in biology and you failed out. Like, you're not actually a doctor, right? You can't represent things that are just not true, right? [snorts] >> And so, there's a whole body of law about what you can say and do that has been around for many, many years, in some cases centuries. We don't need to reinvent this. We just need to return to the common sense and apply it to the internet. >> So, should you be able to call for an armed revolution on Twitter? Actually, I mean, in in my You're asking me about the state of the law or in my heart? In my heart, yes. >> In my heart, yes. >> Now, that doesn't mean I think you should and we're going to gather on Third Street and the arm stock is here and this is how you make the dynamite. No. But if you are saying this is a ridiculous state of affairs, we clearly need a better ruling class. You know, this governor should be, you know, hoisted on his bard and thrown out the window, whatever. Yeah, I think you should be free to say that and think that and feel that. >> You you know what's so interesting is that we went from the model you described until very recently, you know, that Roman model which was here is the approved news. You know, we're going to give it to you and everybody else, you know, it's going to calm people down because they feel they've got the facts. All of a sudden, I don't know about you, Richard, and I don't know if Constantin feels this way. I kind of feel like I've been in in a relationship with somebody and I've just realized they've been lying to me and not only have they been lying to me now, they've been relying throughout the entire relationship. So, I'm now in the position and I think a lot of people are where I'm like, you say this, is it true? Can I believe you? >> Right? And that's the problem with being betrayed because you rese >> and everything that that person or thing has done becomes instantly negative in every detail. >> Mhm. >> But that's an overreaction. That's wrong. >> Look, we all have problems with the BBC. Like what they report and what you see on the I mean you we've all three of us have had the same experience and most of the people watching who are familiar with the BBC about this. They were at an event the [clears throat] BBC covered. They saw what they saw and then they saw the BBC report and you're like hold on like were you guys even in the same room planet >> on the other hand because we feel betrayed we say everything they do is bad they've done some brilliant things over the years >> my favorite and I recommend this to everyone is the Kenneth Clark series Civilization >> which you can watch I think for free on YouTube it's about four hours >> and the BBC was going to go to color in 1967 and they conceived this idea of having this Oxford Dawn talk about the sweep of Western civilization. People actually bought televisions or gathered to watch this series was the first BBC release in color. And the guy at the BBC who decided to give Kenneth Clark this was David Atenbar >> who goes on in the 70s as a Marxist but as a fabulous reporter of nature to give us those now that we now satarize them and joke about them. the these great accounts of how the natural world works. So yes, Francis, we feel betrayed by the BBC, but let's let's not let that color our thinking. They did do some brilliant and beautiful things, right? I gave you a couple examples, but we can all think of others. And but you but in quibbles aside, the official version is not the news. M >> the news, the official version is part of the news, but the rest of the news is the tenacious, independent-minded investigation to get the closest approximation of the truth that you can before your deadline. And that's subversive and it always will be and that's its appeal. >> But look, I'm in agreement with you. But let's take that relationship metaphor. M >> betrayal. It It kind of look the point you make is true, but let's say you've been in a marriage for 30 years, it's really happy and one day your partner cheats on you. >> That is a fundamental breaking of the trust. Yes. >> Relationship. >> Yes. >> And many times it's it doesn't matter what's happened in the 28 years previous if the two years during that time they've been off shagging the secretary. It's incredibly difficult to go, you know what? I'm now going to go back to the previous 28 years. In many ways, you can't do it. You have to have a new relationship with media. >> Right. Yes. And maybe that means they've so destroyed the trust that all of these great brands disappear. >> Or maybe that's not a good idea and we're throwing the baby out with the bathwater. >> I don't know the answer. It's one of those two things, but I really don't know the answer. But I do know this. The so-called great brands, the legacy brands cannot continue in the way they have been doing without restoring the relationship of trust. >> Without trust, you don't have a relationship. >> Well, absolutely. And to extend Franc's metaphor, a thing that I've been somewhat concerned about, hence my kind of pushing back on you to try and find out where the boundaries of what the three of us believe are, is also the fact that when you've been betrayed in a relationship and you leave that relationship, it is very tempting to go, I don't know if you call this this in the US, but we to go on the rebound. >> Yes. >> Which is to get into a series usually of terrible new relationships with really untrustworthy, unsuitable characters. Right. So you leave the New York Times, you end up following uh Crazy Loon on X. >> Correct. And I think we're also, if we're being fair, seeing quite a lot of that going on. >> Oh, absolutely. >> And so that's where it's interesting. But also, I think the technological aspect of this in the current moment is as huge as it was at the times of the printing press and onwards because one of the reasons people under 40 don't watch the news is just we use a different set of technology. >> Yes, >> that's also another thing that's going on. And I imagine if you're a TV executive now, if you've got a brain, what you're going is, how do we make the thing that we currently make more like the thing that the people under 40 are actually watching? >> Right. Yes. It's so bad that the term news for people under 40, they're consuming news and not realizing it because they don't go to the established legacy brands anymore, even online, right? But when you get information from the outside world and use it to make decisions and it's more or less independently created, that is news. But that's not how they think of news. They think of news as whatever the output is of these legacy brands >> and that they don't want. That's toxic. That's distrusted, >> right? And the internet and artificial intelligence presents an enormous opportunity to reinvent how information what I would call news is delivered, how it is gathered, how it is processed and verified and fact checked and then how it is delivered and to whom and on what device. And I think five years from now it'll be completely different across the English speaking world and 10 years from now it'll be completely different everywhere outside of China. >> Describe me the picture that you see 5 and 10 years from now. >> One of my goals for 2026 is to feel in control of my money.

I think we'll see a set of enforcable software rules that will verify that this is a real photograph and not an AI creation. It's a real video. You really did interview uh Kim Kardashian, right? [laughter] Um the uh we will get to see beyond what's in the story to what are the sources behind it. Um what software now makes possible uh through simultaneous automatic instant translation by summing up large data sets right um you can pres you can create an entirely new kind of experience of news um and that's actually something that I'm working on now which I'll be happy to talk about offline >> but the technology is beyond exciting. And I'm not the only one thinking about this. There are other people, some in legacy places, some in startups, who are thinking about this, too. There's a lot going on. And if the great and the good can back off and the journalism schools can stop telling us how things should be and let things evolve, I think we could get beyond the official version and have I mean, think about who also could be drawn. This this field is more people have left uh journalism in [clears throat] the past 20 years than any other field. >> The US Department of Labor keeps track of this in the United States. And the job description of newsroom reporter has shed more jobs than steel workers, iron workers, than any other profession they track in since since 2000. That should be reversed. Why isn't everyone who's creating a a YouTube channel and struggling to monetize it not able to create content that meets a set of verification rules and then goes into a marketplace and becomes available to every device on the internet. You can take it or not take it. Think about the differences in perspective that would be possible if you have a single mother in Mexico City covering something and a college professor in Boston covering that same thing and a structural engineer uh out in can you know Overland Park Kansas looking at that same thing and they're both f all three of them are following the the objective verification rules that the software makes possible and they're all reporting it but they're reporting it and asking the questions and wondering the things and investigating from their own perspectives. I guarantee you they'd see it all differently. >> And it's such a good point. But if we focus, for instance, on the Charlie Kirk assassination, which is obviously awful and terrible, you have lots of people talking about it. And it became quite a fascinating case study to look at people's reactions including established journalists and [snorts] seeing how people reported. And the thing that worries me, Richard, is that the incentives become not to tell the truth, not even to sensationalize the truth, but to spread conspiracy theories because that's where the money is. The money is not in the truth. >> Right. Well, I would divide the conspiracy theories into two pieces, right? Some are the nativeorn conspiracy theories. That is to say, I'm not talking about the citizen sh status of these people. I'm just saying people who reside in our societies who uh think whatever they think. That's sort of item one, bundle one. Over here we also have a lot of bots uh run by the Iranians, the Russians, the Chinese and other groups who are trying to sew division and plant ideas in our society and by our society I mean the western world and divide it uh over stupid issues and distract right and you know the medieval mind used to worry whether the ideas in your in their heads were their own or put there by some demon. When we consume the internet, first question we ought to ask is, is this put here by Qatar or Iran or I don't know uh any >> China, Russia. >> Yeah. Or some interest group in in our country or another European country or Australian whatever. >> So who is putting this out? We do know that during the 2020 campaign, for example, more than half of the followers, online followers of the Biden campaign were bots and some of them run out of India and Bangladesh by people who couldn't even speak English. So these are just fake followers, fake social media cred given to conspiracy theories. >> I don't think the answer is censorship. Let's crack down on all the crazy thoughts. let other people answer back and in the balance of things the truth will sort itself out. But I do think we need to think about homegrown. I think the crazy people here get to have their say. But I don't think we need to import. We don't need electronic immigration into Western society from Russia, China, and other authoritarian places. >> And we need to find a solution to that because if we don't, then what we have, as you say, are these people spouting crazy theories who are artificially boosted. Like I go on my social media and I'm going this is patently nonsense yet it's got 3 million views. How is this >> right? I mean all this like pro- Hitler stuff online. It's got to be manufactured. I just I just can't believe that there is any real audience for a failed evil dictator who died what 80 years ago, right? I mean, it's just there's no like pro-Napoleon groups to pick another dictator from a different country, right? Uh or pro-Stalin groups online. So, it's why is it all focused on this? Well, that serves the ideological needs of the current Russian government to pretend they're fighting Nazis in the Ukraine and so therefore they want to say there are Nazis everywhere, >> right? Is there some crazy people in a shack in rural Idaho who truly believe this? I can't rule it out. I don't know but the online prevalence has got to be from a foreign intelligence service or foreign companies aligned with uh foreign intelligence services. And then we need to look at the payments made to influencers, people who are legitimate members of our society who have very large followings who suddenly start saying and doing things that don't fit with the last few decades of our experience of them. Mhm. >> Like, hm, why why are you suddenly saying that Churchill was a bad guy or, you know, maybe we weren't the good guys in World War II or this dictatorial regime, the Middle East, is actually a great place. Like, why are we saying these things, right? [clears throat] Are they receiving money? Who knows? >> I certainly have no evidence. I'm not going to say things I don't have evidence for. But you do see a lot of out of character moves. And we do see people on both the left and the right who seem to have been funded from overseas. And we at least ought to have a rule that if you're taking foreign money, you have to declare it openly so people know. Fair warning, hey, you're secretly being paid off by Lickenstein, that's why your views on banking are what they are. You know >> why not, right? You have to list the ingredients on the food you buy. If you're taking money from over from outside of NATO, tell us. Just tell us. You can say whatever you're going to say, but how about, you know, a little warning label? >> Well, and maybe one of the I'm certain I don't think censorship is the answer to any of it, but I I also wonder where the real journalism's answer to it. Where are the investigative journalisms who are where are the investigative journalists who are I can't say that line for some reason. Where are the investigative journalists who are looking into those allegations? because uh every time I post anything that's remotely pro Israel, people say, \"I've got $7,000 for that post.\" Well, I I welcome people to look into that theory and find out. Likewise with the people you're talking about. Let's find out who who's >> getting a few people, first of all, don't understand the economics, right? >> An online video ad is what 12 or 15 cents per thousand impressions. Is that about right? >> Maybe you do a bit better with sponsorships and things. It takes millions of views to to to make a number interesting at all. Where are the investigative journalists? Investigative journalism is literally the today is the most expensive form of journalism. >> Right? >> So you need a very profitable publication that also has an open and exploratory mind. Two things together >> in order to have a crew of investigative journalists. >> And then not anyone can be an investigative. You have to apprentice. You have to study how to do it. There are there's a lot of tacit knowledge, a lot of skills that have to be developed to really do this. Uh, and the people who think that news ought to be the official story of something are very incurious. Do do you hear the story about the guy running for US Senator Maine who had a toteen coff tattoo on his chest, >> right? And incredibly the guy takes his shirt off and and and displays it in a video. Like I would think if you had a Totten cough tattoo, you would have quietly changed that years ago. But here's the thing. Here's my question. Why? He said he got it in Croatia. Are toten cough tattoos common in Croatia? I don't know. Probably not. But why hasn't somebody tracked down the tattoo parlor and interviewed the artist and say, \"Do you have a whole like special book of Nazi tattoos? >> Is this a common thing you do? >> Do you remember talking to this guy?\" Right. >> Um and in these kinds of questions which aren't it's not with social media that expensive to find that person in >> Croatia >> but it is time and money but they aren't minded to do it. They don't have the curiosity to see well how did this happen right what are the facts and a lot of your online influencer type people don't have the investigative skills takes years to hone this. You need to find, you know, you need to know what databases to consult, what's trustworthy, what's your, how do you design an investigation. That takes time and practice. And frankly, you make mistakes. It's one of the ways you learn, right? >> So, this has atrophied on the left and never really developed on the right. >> And until there's a budget and a curious mind to support it, uh, you won't see more of it. you'll continue to see less and less of it. However, I think when technology changes what kind of news is possible. Technology can also lower the cost of finding out new things. If you really get smart at writing software, you could find that Croatian tattoo artist in a in in a fraction of a minute and then you can contact them across the world and say, \"Hey, can I come see you? I'd like to I'd like to look through your because they all have sample books of tattoos they make and they have a portfolio of the ones they're most proud of, >> right? and just o have an open-minded interview with the guy and what would you maybe he doesn't remember the night but if it turns out oh yeah we keep a small book in the back you have to specially request it for the Nazi stuff >> or no we don't do that this guy came in with the design and showed it to us and we copied it >> two different set of facts >> but how did this tattoo come to be just an interesting investigation right and Croatia has you know interesting ties with the Nazi party in World War II could be a cultural memory there. If he had this tattoo in Spain, I would be a lot more surprised. But Croatia >> um the Nazis hung on to that to the bitter end. The militias associated with Croatia did horrible things uh against not just the partisans of Tito, but ordinary civilians and religious minorities. Um so is it possible? Sure. >> And that's the thing that worries me about the death of the mainstream media. I don't know if you've ever seen the movie Spotlight. >> Yes. >> Which is a brilliant movie. It's uh it's about the Boston I can't remember the newspaper. We >> The Boston Globe >> the Boston Globe in an investigation into pedophilia into the Catholic Church in in Boston. >> And you watch this and it's based on a true story >> and you think to yourself, that's such an important public service. >> Yes, >> it's an important public service because there is always going to be corruption. There is always going to be abuse. And the best of the journalists in my opinion, I'm sure you probably agree, were the people who exposed that. And there's never going to be any less of that because human beings are what they are. So if we don't have those people exposing it, then we're going to be in a much darker and more unsafe world. >> Absolutely. First of all, Boston at the time was a Catholic majority city. Going after the largest religion among your readership group takes guts, >> but behind that guts means you have a journalistic culture that is got a sense of fearlessness and recklessness, but it also has the professionalism to structure an investigation, to go about it, to make sure the witnesses are actually independent of each other. Right? So, if you have two people who claim they saw something, but they're both friends with each other, they're not really independent eyewitnesses. >> Um, now it's also interesting their their choice of targets, right? If you went after psychologists, um, especially people dealing with women following divorce or battered women, there's a horrendous amount of sexual abuse there that never really gets investigated. Uh there's also a tremendous amount of sexual abuse among in public schools by teachers against children. >> Oddly enough, it appears and I've not made a real thorough study of this women against male teenagers. Uh those things don't get investigated because they don't serve a larger narrative >> with but still I think it took guts. Spotlight was a useful thing. uh the church should be investigated like every public institution >> and also I think it's important that the people in charge of vulnerable people have no sexual or financial interest in those people that is very important and we too often say in the name of rights and equality oh well we should let this person supervise these people or be in control of this group of people and that person could be great on an individual basis, but as a general rule that will cause problems in the end as we saw in in sort of military training when we have male drill instructors over female recruits. There were abuses. I mean, we we have to be mindful of this and we have to be clever about how we design incentives and how we surveil to make sure that wrongdoing isn't happening. And part of that is the media's job. And thank God for the Boston Globe going after the Catholic Church. And I hope they go after all the other sacred cows because accountability is desperately needed in all aspects of our society. And I'm afraid if we lose legacy media, we lose the muscle memory to do these kind of investigations. >> Richard, that's us. Thank you very much. >> Thank you. [music] >> Other examples of times and places where distrust in media is as high as it is today. If so, [music] how is that trust regained within those societies? >> [music]"

    "transcript": "Why reform has no choice. Over recent days, there's been much debate in British politics about the future of Nigel Farage's reform party. Cemented by the defection of Robert Generick, the conservative shadow secretary of state for justice and shadow law chancellor, who was pushed by Tory leader Kame Bedon as he was about to jump ship. Reform is developing a reputation for moving to the center. Generic followed in the footsteps of a number of senior or formerly senior conservatives including Nadim Zahawi, Nadine Doris, Jake Barry and others. As a curious aside, the last time I saw Jake Barry was on question time when he challenged me on my criticism of net zero to explain that net zero is the solution, not the problem. We have to let go some of our obsessions like net zero and so on and we will find out if the government's prepared to do that. >> Okay, man there in the glasses. And just to pick up on what Constantine said, you are so wrong. We do not deliver a growing northern economy by turning our back on net zero. The north of England, this county, this region is a global leader in green technology. We deliver a better leveled up north of England by having green collar, highly paid, secure jobs for people who live in this region. Net zero is the solution, not the problem. I think it's good for your voters to hear that. Um I'm sure Conservative Party voters will be pleased. But um >> the program was recorded as Nadim Zahari was in the process of being sacked as Conservative Party chairman because he'd failed to declare that HMRC was in the middle of an investigation into his personal tax affairs when he was appointed to various ministerial positions. This anecdote alone gives you a flavor of the sort of concerns many have raised about the increasing torification of reform. Last night, it was confirmed that another MP, Andrew Rosendelle, had defected to reform, bringing the number of reform MPs to seven, of whom more than half are now Tory defectors. Lee Anderson, Danny Krueger, Robert Generick, and Andrew Rosendelle himself. The worry for many is that as conservative refugees become more numerous than native reformers within the party, the center of gravity will shift away from reform's radical agenda towards the very policies and personalities they so thoroughly rejected at the last election. Reform's defiant position against the failed status quo was what won them their legion of supporters. Now, some feel they're cozying up to it. Personnel is policy after all and having forced out tough-talking right-wingers like Rupert Low and Benhabib, reform appears to be going slightly vegan. It's rare for me to be accused of naive optimism. But in this instance, I do not actually share these concerns for a number of reasons which we'll come to shortly. But first, and much more importantly, we have to recognize that reform has no choice but to continue salvaging what they can from the rotting carcass of the Conservative Party. Why? Because Britain is not America. Our electoral system does not allow a charismatic leader with a small band of acolytes to storm to power in the way that President Trump did with just JD Vance, RFK Jr., Elon Musk, Telsey Gabbed, and VC Ramaswami at his side. To become prime minister, Nigel Farage has to have 650 men and women stand as candidates in constituencies across the country and more than half of them to actually be elected. Even now when much of the public is fed up with the status quo and kastama enjoying the lowest favorability ratings in history, having a reform rosette pinned on you will not guarantee victory in a specific constituency, especially to an unknown politically inexperienced candidate. Once elected, that MP will be faced with the reality that standing as an MP is almost the exact opposite of being an MP. A political campaign is about making speeches, knocking on doors, and selling yourself to the public. But once the sale is made, your constituents need you to solve their problems. Making witty comebacks on TV requires an entirely different skill set to filling potholes. And metaphorical potholes are no small matter, nor one to worry about once the election is in the bag. The only way reform can succeed as a political project is to win the war of the next election and then win the peace by actually delivering both locally and nationally. Which brings us to the final reason why reform has no choice. If elected, the biggest challenge they face is turning the sinking oil tanker that is Britain around. This will require an understanding of how the machinery of government works, something that can only come from experience of being in government. Many recent defectors are being described as Tory failures. And in a sense, this is fair and correct. The Tories failed. But what the public do not know is that the Tories failed despite many of their ministers being talented and brilliant people. This is not a joke. It's a tragedy. Having met a number of the people who would be at the very top of your list of incompetent, self-serving, unprincipled, slithering creatures, I can tell you the tragedy is that most of them are none of those things. Many were good, capable people trying their best within a party that had lost its way. Dealing with an openly rebellious civil service and operating within the suffocating straight jacket of powerful Blair legislation which curbed their ability to actually govern the country. Put simply, you need Tory failures to avoid reform failing in the same way. This was of course what President Trump and his team learned from his first term in office. They spent four years trying to do things and being obstructed at every turn. It was only on his triumphant return to office that the Trump administration has been able to actually implement their agenda. This explains part of my lack of acute concern about this trend within reform. This was always going to happen. Indeed, by the time of the next election, I expect the entire Tory right to have switched to reform with up to 60 reform candidates being current conservative MPs. But the other reason for my optimism is that ultimately the direction of a political party is set at the top. Nigel Farage, his immensely impressive great cardinal James Ore and the rest of the leadership card are no wets. As long as they're in charge, reform will remain radical in the healthy sense of the word. They're not extremists, which is a strength, not a weakness. The very online world rewards the hotness of one's takes, but electoral politics in Britain rewards a strong, cleareyed focus on the silent majority who are tired of economic stagnation, illegal immigration, rising crime, and crumbling infrastructure. The public are angry and they are frustrated. But they aren't extremists, nor will they tolerate extremism. For every vote won by posting unworkable demands on Twitter, there are five to be lost in the country at large. Many activists and commentators feel that the next election is the last opportunity to turn things around. I agree. However, urgency requires more pragmatism, not less. Whether you're a centrist like me or an ardent right-winger, the recognition of this reality must force you towards realism. Reform is the only party capable of winning the next election. Purity spiraling about how they are not right-wing enough will only make the outcomes you want less likely. We're drinking at the last chance saloon. Drink responsibly.

The news doesn't just tell you what's happening. It so often tells you what to think is happening. And these days, the biggest red flag isn't what's said, it's what gets left out. That's why I use Ground News. It's the only site and app that compares coverage from across the political spectrum and highlights which stories are being ignored entirely. See for yourself at ground.news/trigonometry. Their blind spot feed is one of my favorite features. It surfaces around 20 stories a day that are being overlooked by either the left or the right. It's a simple but powerful way to track media bias in real time. Like this. NIH scientists recently published a declaration criticizing Trump's cuts to public health research. That's a major move. And yet only 2% of the coverage came from right-leaning outlets. A new study found that 2024 saw the most armed conflicts globally since 1946. A staggering statistics, but you would have missed it if you'd only read left-wing news sources. Ground News gives you the full picture. headlines, ownership, bias ratings, and context so you can actually understand what's going on, not just react to what you're told. Head to ground.new/trigonometry for 40% off their unlimited advantage plan, the same one we use, and start thinking for yourself."

    "transcript": "When Charlie Kirk was murdered, you were actually the number one person I thought about. Is there a a a skew in attitudes to political violence? >> I think we've seen an authorizing environment for violence on both sides. I know SCOPs when I see them, and I know persuasion techniques when I see them. We almost can't comprehend a troll farm with thousands of people and thousands of devices and tens of thousands of comments flooding into our networks and our social media and flooding into our kids and the effect that has. The real aim with with these mechanisms that are out of control is to get the far left and the far right and a lot of this is young men to meet at that horseshoe of nihilism. I believe it's unequivocal that DI and oppression and anti-semitism and microaggression training not only is ineffective but that it drives the opposite effect because what you foreclose you make forbidden and what you make forbidden becomes taboo and what becomes taboo becomes sacred and alluring. >> Greg, welcome to trigonometry. >> Thank you. Thanks for having me on, John. >> It's good to have you on. We're going to talk about assassination culture, political violence in America, the divisions that this country is now experiencing as well. When Charlie Kirk was murdered in the horrific way that he was, you know, the initial reaction for me was obviously concerned for his family. You know, we didn't even know he was going to survive. Well, when I thought a little bit later about the political ramifications of all of this, you were actually the number one person I thought about because you've been thinking and researching and studying the issue of political violence for a long time. Tell us a little bit about your background, how you've come to where you are and what you do now. >> Well, I'm a novelist is my day job and I write spy thrillers and other kinds of thrillers which have had me in all sorts of unusual circumstances. I've gone undercover in a mind control cult. I've snuck on the demolition ranges with seals of blown up cars and I know scops when I see them and I know persuasion techniques when I see them. And so my interest in politics sort of came around 2015 when I was noticing some of the language control happening on the left. And I just thought there's no way that wouldn't lead to a big resentful populist tide. And so I got involved initially trying to help pull the Democrats back from the far left with, as you might imagine, has had limited success and then increasingly starting to recognize that there there are sort of these mirror images that are happening within the culture and that the real lines are not red or blue. The real lines are really going to be psychopaths and extremists and proiteeers versus everybody else in the middle. And so I've I've devoted my focus to that and calling that out which is you know means calling out things on both the left and the right the far left and the far right. And also you know it's a process of undeceiving because a lot of ways that I went in were proven wrong with contact with reality in the real situation which you hope happens. So I've I've had to learn a lot too. >> And what have you learned? What what are the what is the evidence? What do the does the research that you've done show about political violence attitudes to political violence? Obviously, we've had the Luigi Manjone situation, Charlie, I mentioned as well. Um, what can you tell us about people's attitudes and where this is all coming from? >> Well, I think there's three major factors and I think the first is hostile foreign regimes. We almost can't comprehend a troll farm in St. Petersburg or troll farms in China are run by the Islamic Republic with thousands of people and thousands of devices and tens of thousands of comments flooding into our networks and our social media and flooding into our kids and the effect that has. So number one is there are people out there who do not want what is best for us who are seeking to divide and destroy us. The second thing is we have psychopathic algorithms. the algorithms are feeding outrage and they're feeding, you know, they're on boarding, the recommendation structures are on boarding because they're designed to maximize for profit and maximum stickiness is going to be things that are most atrocious. And then we have bad faith domestic players um who are stoking this who have, you know, either interest in more greed or power or being overtly paid off by foreign companies. And so you have all these incentive structures that are massively offkilter. And when you look at radicalization, when I went undercover in mind control cults, it's funny. So I wrote a book about this, one of my fifth thriller, and parents would write me and say, \"My kid just went into a mind control cult. What do I do?\" And the first thing I said is, \"Do not send them articles telling them they're in a mind control cult.\" >> Right? That that play has already been anticipated and it's already been answered. >> And so one of the things that you try and do is you put people in touch with a previous version of themselves. So if someone's in a cult, you say, \"Hey, when you were in college, what was your dream for yourself when you were in your late 20s now? It's you create a cognitive dissonance within them.\" And to see the process of radicalization with Charlie Kirk, I mean, for me, my first reaction, I was it was I was horrified. Um, it was a it was a major uh shift in a lot of things for me. Um, I didn't know Charlie, but to me, there's a lot of my friends who could have been in that seat and in that chair. >> And then the other thing I just thought back with the sort of confusion of this reaction that everybody seemed to have and beyond the the dark tetrad types are going to celebrate this. And >> what's the dark tetrd type? >> Oh, it's people who are mchavelian, sadistic, narcissistic, um, and psychopathic. And all that they want is control of profit and and they they want control and to maximize sort of evil and sadism online for power and they gravitate wherever power is. So we saw a lot of that on the left and then as Trump and MAGA became ascendant they're going to shift over to any place where there's more power. >> So they're going to celebrate anything. They're nihilists. >> Um but the the ambiguity of the mainstream reaction or even the caveats, right? like, well, I don't agree with everything he said, but it was so striking to me and I thought, well, and and I I wrote about this a little bit. If we were to rewind, I'm a bit older than you guys, I think, but let's rewind to when I was in college, which was a relatively more sane time in the '9s. There was a very prominent conservative professor called Harvey Mansfield who was on campus. A lot of the students didn't agree with him. He was one of the, you know, he was in a cohort with Bill Crystal. He was sort of a solid position there at Harvard when I was an undergraduate back when it wasn't embarrassing to go to Harvard. >> Um at the same time there was a very prominent feminist called Andrea Dwarkin who you probably know right and she thought that all intercourse all heterosexual intercourse was she had very extremist views. >> Both of them were very much outside the mainstream of what would have been acceptable. Had one of them been executed on campus in the9s in front of 3,000 kids live streamed to hundreds thousands more. The reaction would have been unequivocal horror. It would have been unequivocal across the campus, across the city, the state, the nation, and the mainstream media. It would have been unequivocal. And radicalization. We have a saying, I write thrillers, as I mentioned. There's a saying in thrillers which is the bad guy never thinks he's the bad guy. >> You never think you're the one who's radicalized. But if you go back and look at that, the fact that people felt that they had to stammer like they had to talk about with Banion to say, \"Well, I really don't like some of the healthc care policies, but that's a that's a sign of radicalization and it happens as slow as a frog being boiled.\" Um, I'd say the other biggest lesson that I learned, and it's helped me kind of view the chess board differently, is that particularly when we're dealing with these foreign hostile regimes that are fueling a lot of this, their aim isn't left versus right. The KGB in the in the Cold War did a lot of funding and logistic support for the Black Panthers. And they also wrote letters, forged letters from the KKK threatening black leadership. They want to fund both sides so that we destroy each other and we can't think about any of the topics. The real aim with with these mechanisms that are out of control is to get the far left and the far right and a lot of this is young men to meet at that horseshoe of nihilism and that's where no lives matter is and some of that confusion that we see where we're going well I think he was far right but he had no king's flyers in his car. There's a confusion. It doesn't mean that there aren't distinct threats from the left and distinct threats from the right, but they don't care once somebody arrives at that. They don't care if the next bus they get on is violent Antifa or is your body my choice gropers. They just care that it will be destructive and that none of us can talk about it because we're so busy blaming the other side. That's what the win is. >> And when you talk about these men who end up, let's just call the no lives matter zone. What it strikes me is that these men, these are men who are isolated. Because if you start to stray into this kind of dangerous territory and you know, you've got a girlfriend, you've got friends and family around you, and you start saying this stuff, they're more likely to go, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's let's have a conversation about this.\" But if you're isolated and you're online 24/7, that's when things start getting dangerous, isn't it? >> That's right. And the biggest predictor is m is is a ton of social media use. So the biggest predictor more than 50% higher than anything o for man support 50% higher than than discord or reddit or anything was blue sky usage >> which is ostensibly the safe space on the internet. So there's a mirroring effect that happens there. And you know we have similar stuff that happens on the far right. We tracked last year 14 posts from the biggest hate accounts and unequivocal posts like not stuff that's like oh that's mean or that's stereotypical or that might be funny in certain circumstances but unequivocal posts. We track those to 6.5 billion impressions and I think we still have a belief. I mean, I can't be in Twitter too long without starting to lose my mind a little bit. And you feel that and you have to pull out and you have to re We still have a belief somehow that we can go into an arena that is designed by addiction teams of addiction specialists that is targeting us based on I think there's 26 different ways they read what our eyes track to, where our thumb snags, what grabs our attention, backed by deep machine learning algorithms. and we think we can hold our own. Let alone kids, young young people, let's just say kids prefrontal cortex doesn't mileinate till they're 23 or 24. They literally don't have grown in prefrontal cortexes. And if you take them out of a system where they're not educated, they don't have a robust educated mind. They haven't been raised in places where um you're arguing. You've read something of a canon. you've read something of let's say Duffy Orwell you know pick your poison Sultzan if you don't have any grounding for that and you're being inundated and targeted that's full-blown mind control that's more powerful than we are >> absolutely and when you factor in that young men in particular are going to be far more extreme than a man in his 40s just because that's the way young men are >> that's also a recipe for disaster isn't it? Yes, absolutely. And it and then you add on top of this um a culture that has been pervasively telling them that any expression of their strength or solidity or properly targeted aggression into sports, into debate, into daring is is a toxic notion that is inherent to them. There's not a lot of great places for them to go. And one of the things that the that the I I hate using these terms, the mainstream, they're also captured, but let's just call it the left and the mainstream has really trained their targets on a body of people who were the most effective bull works against those young men being on boarded into actual alt-right extremism. That's Charlie Kirk. That's Jordan Peterson. These are people who, you know, Jordan >> was my undergraduate thesis adviser. I go back a long ways with him. the amount of of anger and vitriol I've heard about him from the far left, which is completely divorced from his actual viewpoints, they don't they don't have a comprehension that with him, the message that he is giving is the message that these young men can hear that's going to be functional. He's an ally and we've lost an ability to look at a chessboard because we pick out one thing that somebody said out of context and we dismiss them unequivocally. >> And that's something it's just got to stop. And the same with Charlie Kirk. I mean, I had a I wrote a piece on on Charlie Kirk. Um, there's a number of reasons why I found that particularly devastating. I think there were three. Um, it it was him. I think it was the the the pre-ternatural grace of his wife. Um, it was my shock at the reaction to the mainstream and to some of the people on I'll call it the left side of the arena. And then also it was this feeling of of isolation in the reasonable center to say how how does everybody not just get this that this is a moment >> to get completely and we've had these moments. We had it with Representative Hortman who was shot in in Minneapolis. But, you know, Charlie was the face of a movement and argued more articulately and beautifully and convincingly for a ton of values that were around a free marketplace of ideas around including different people with different orientations and beliefs in the conservative movement. He was a bull work to that. And people think you can just get rid of him and then some far-left figure is going to speak to these people. It's a name. Um and so we have a lot of work to do on both sides. >> Well, what you speaking of both sides and so far you've talked about this as an issue of the far left and the far right. But when we spoken to people, everyone on the right and this we saw this after Charlie was was murdered. You know, there were a lot of people saying, well, you know, the Democrats are the party of murder. This is the left that did this. Uh that's the message from one side. Sitting in in that very chair only, you know, a while ago as we record this was Sam Harris who said, \"Well, actually, you know, he's more worried about the threat from the right.\" Um, you know, he mentioned Paul Pelosi, uh, people laughing about the fact that he was attacked with a hammer, nearly killed on the right. Um, is the is this an all sides problem? Does it break evenly for each side? Is there a a a skew in attitudes to political violence? Can you tell us more about that? >> I think we've seen an authorizing environment for violence on both sides. >> I think that >> I always feel like when we're discussing this, we're taking our eyes off the chessboard to some sense, but it's a fair question to ask, right? And I think that part of the problem is >> going into this year, I told myself I was finally going to stop guessing about my health. Like most people, I want more energy, better focus, and to be still strong and sharp years from now. But every time I've gone to the doctor, I walk out with basically nothing. Everything's fine. Drink more water, sleep a bit more. No real insight, no plan, just vibes. That's why Superpowers stood out to me. Superpower makes it simple to actually understand what's going on inside your body. You do one blood draw either at home or in a nearby lab and they analyze over a 100 biomarkers. That's heart health, hormones, metabolism, vitamins, minerals, and even environmental toxins. What I love is that you don't just get numbers. You get a personalized action plan, supplements, nutrition guidance, lifestyle changes, and even your true biological age that you can track over time. Price-wise, this is a no-brainer compared to the alternatives. Superpower used to cost $499. Right now, it's $1.99, while other testing services charge $500, $1,000, sometimes more for similar, often inferior information. Your blueprint activated with Superpower. Superpower is just $1.99 and for a limited time, you can get an additional $20 off with our code Trigger. Head to superpower.com and use code trigger at checkout for $20 off your membership. After you sign up, they'll ask you how you heard about them. So, make sure to mention trigonometry to support the show. Once again, head to superpower.com and use our code trigger at checkout. I think that for the first time this we get into this problem with trusted experts and expertise. What stats are you looking at? Matt Walsh is going to look at one set of statistics, right? Sam Harris is going to look at another one. I think we see very, very troubling patterns on both sides. Some of the stuff that's happened online is insane. I think what Sam is referring to is when the angry far right gets woken up, they're very, very angry and very, very capable. And we've seen again and again the left playing around with these ideas that the left then can that the right can pick up. And there's reasons why the right can do some things better that are both bad and good. Likewise with the left. Um, but you know, safe spaces on college campuses, right? Let's let's scream at Jordan Peterson so he can't go anywhere. Let's grab Ben Shapiro's notes. Let's do all this stuff. And there's no thought to what will happen when that power gets transferred over to the right. Um, the right is very capable in terms of um if there's a war with guns and with organized militia groups, I think they're going to do a lot better than the Antifa group, you know, who are holding down a zone in Portland. They're they're just going to. They haven't. so far gone to that full extent and there's also differences in what we're talking about between the political arena which I know Sam is very concerned with and things that we're talking about that are extracurricular. >> So it's I think it's very difficult to untangle and I think that in a lot of ways they're a mirror side of the other because somebody sees something happen and they say we have no choice but to align with the worst allies that we have on our side and I've watched the Democrats do that. I think my position right now is I'm so I'm so frustrated with the Democrats and their unwillingness to acknowledge the dangers of the far left. >> Can we talk about big five personality theory for a moment because I think this is an answer. >> I'm sorry I'm taking some time with this. It's it's a complicated answer and I don't want to give a pat answer. >> Big five personality structure determines our political orientation more than anything else aside from the family that we're born into. And so there's something called high trade openness, right? Do you like new experiences? Do you like new people and foods? Liberals tend to be higher in high trade openness. And so that's a really interesting thing. That's why we congregate in cities, let's say, right? Different people and voices and accents. We're open to different kinds of experiences. My trait structure lies down that way along a very classically liberal trait structure. >> Um, and agree and there's something called empathy. There's empathy which tucks under something called agreeableness. Right? So that's another kind of complicated thing. And Democrats tend to think that this is sort of superior that all you need is to expose more people to more different viewpoints and higher empathy and then the world will be solved. Conservatives are lower in trade openness and that codes for a lot of other things. They like borders around things. They like predictability. They like being surrounded with people who think and move like them. Farmers and ranchers. There's a set schedule. This is nothing to do with race. It's not white people versus black or brown people. that's evenly distributed across every single group. Whether you think that that's a god-given thing or evolutionarily selected for how we navigate. Um, and conservatives are hiring a different trait which is called high trait conscientiousness. So with openness, they say, I want less openness, right? I want a border around the country, build a wall. I want borders around gender. Right? If there's a couple examples that don't fit, that's fine. But we all know that there's two genders and that's what we define it. I want a border where my skin starts and your vaccination wants to begin. Okay, these are deep psychological traits. These are also very useful traits. Imagine the Native Americans when the Europeans came with smallox blankets if they said, \"Hang on a minute, like we need to have a little bit more in-group protection before we deal with this issue of of infection from what can happen with different outroups.\" We've robbed the right in a lot of ways. the I'm sorry the prevailing ideologies of the left have robbed the right in a lot of ways of an organizing principle for the ingroup. So can it be that you're Christian and being Christian will exclude certain people from certain activities as much as being Jewish does or being anything does? That's something that's called Christian nationalism. All nationalism gets grouped in with Adolf Hitler. If you c you can't have pride in your country anymore. So here we have this this more closed trait, but there's not a group that they can identify under with a structure that is acceptable to a lot of parts of the mainstream and we need to untangle that. Now conservatives are also higher in something called trait conscientiousness. And trait conscientiousness is like, do you return phone calls? Do you show up on time? Do you do what you're going to say? >> So think about CEOs versus visionaries, right? Steve Jobs big crazy and then they're like wait we need to bring in you know conservative conscientious CEOs to make sure the trains run on time they boot Steve Jobs everything runs on time loses the vision you need to bring them back in and the point of this more than anything is is that we desperately need each other that's why there is an even distribution of this trait structure is whether from evolution or from God and we need to modulate because the job of liberals is to say look if you build a wall and you make it impenetrable and new ideas can't get in and new people can't get in and new kinds of workers can't get in and we can't infuse that with the center which is something that that the founding texts from the Bible to the constitution to the civil rights movement which like every key juncture has a plan for how the fringe interacts with the center. If we don't do that we will stagnate and die. So one is the brakes. Let's go a little slower and make sure things are working and make sure we're not doing away with our traditions that hold order. and the other says we need to move forward and we need to keep integrating. Either one of those is a disaster. If you stomp on the brakes, Democrats will go flying off a cliff following other lemming cars off the cliff or smash into a wall and conservatism will stomp on the brakes and not integrate. And so what we need to do now, I think, in in a very significant way is to upgrade our reference points. We're stuck with old reference points. We think every activist is John Lewis or Hervey Mil, >> right? We think that every notion of nationalism is Adolf Hitler >> and we have to start you we think every intervention is it Chamberlain getting off the plane waving the piece of paper or is it Vietnam? Well, how about it's neither. How about we are in history in a way that's real and that the reference points of old that we use to point and blame well you have more violence here and you have more violence there. I see this as a mirror image that that if we started sitting on a seessaw bouncing back and forth finding balance, if the left moves this way, the right moves this way. The left moves this way, the right moves this way. And the voices that will lift their can lift above partisan values to things that are transcendent, which is what I I thought Erica Kirk did at the at Charlie's memorial. Those are the things that are transformational when we say we're not looking here and here because we're squabbbling here and that's to the delight of let's say elements within China who want to see us weaken elements of Russia want to see us weaken and it also makes sure that we can't have any sane dialogue around solutions because if all we're talking about is well is it the left is it the right and we're waring ourselves where we're putting ourselves into war parties we can't have the discussions with nuance to address the real issues. Well, I totally see what you're saying. I agreed with literally every word you said until that very moment. And I really don't agree with you on that because in order to solve any problem, you have to identify what's actually happening. So, if it is something that is happening across the political spectrum and it's this mutual radicalization you're talking about, that's one problem. If you've got quote unquote assassination culture on the left, that's another problem. If you've got militias >> Mhm. >> organizing in in the in remote parts of Idaho, just to pick a state, whatever, that's a third problem, right? >> So, I guess what I'm asking first of all, what is the problem exactly? I think all three of those are problems and I think that the means by which we're having conversations to solve them are by design ineffective and aren't leading to better solutions for them. they're leading to more partisan warfare. I think all three of those are problems and they probably need different methods of address. >> Well, that's what I'm thinking about because it's almost like you you have these algorithms, you have these media ecosystems and you see it. I mean, one of the reasons I think uh a lot of the kind of online right is getting more extreme now is their parties in power in this country. And so beating up on the Democrats, well, who cares about that? It's not going to get any clicks. uh the arguments have been won and so you have to amp up the conspiracy, the crazy, the whatever, you have to go further to to you know to to spice up the food so to speak, right? >> Um >> and you have a tilt of psychopaths who are moving when you have a certain group that's in power with a different set of rights, let's say with rapid onset gender dysphoria where there's something you start to see a migration of dark tetrad types to that. So you see this movement wherever power is because if you're a dark tetrad player, you go where there's power and then you have grift that you can manipulate people and get closer to power. And so we have seen a gravitation to that with ascendant >> conservativism, ascendant republicanism that a lot of bad faith players are moving over that way. >> Um now the one advantage that I think conservatives have is they're much better at drawing lines. We talked about that low trade openness >> and already in a lot of ways I think that we're seeing some line drawing from the far >> right of people saying that doesn't represent us and I I my hope is that conservatives and I think they're already doing this in a good sense um will not make the mistakes that liberals made because liberals said Trump is such a giant threat. He's such a unique thrust in the history of the world. And I always say if Donald Trump represents the maximum version of evil that you can imagine, you have a very limited imagination. >> Um, and I'm saying this is somebody who uh opposed him quite vehemently early on, but am also looking at and recognizing a lot of nuance in who he is and what he's doing and where the playing field actually is now in America and the world. Liberals basically reached for progressives, lefties. It went it went all the way and there was very little line drawing. And I implored them at every turn. You must denounce Antifa. The notion of sanctuary cities doesn't make sense. Words aren't violence. Topic after topic after topic. When somebody went and kicked down Tucker Carlson's front door or tried to and his wife locked herself in a pantry, I said, \"You have to denounce that. I don't care what you feel about Tucker Carlson. You have to denounce mob violence.\" >> Mob violence will not create the conditions, right? your your own by which a liberal society is going to thrive. It won't do it. And there's a real problem of drawing lines because of that high openness. What if I offend somebody? What if I have a junior staffer who just graduated from a liberal arts college who's offended with something? There's a lot more parsing around empathy and openness and the right has an advantage. And we're seeing a lot of voices on the right say, \"Nope, that's going to be out of bounds.\" And I think whoever does that is ultimately going to win the day because I think there's I think there's three groups right now that hold power within America in certain ways that are essential and that are speaking to the next generation. Um one of them is the DSA, the far left >> Democratic Socialist of America. >> Yes. Thank you. And that's M Donnie. That's AOC. There's there's variations between that. I mean Bernie's in one place. AOC's in another. To my mind, Mr. Mdani is is very further left and there's an element of of Islamicism that that embodies that. You have moderate Democrats who have an incredibly important ballast right now but virtually no reach into propagation making their own weather in the news and speaking to the younger two generations. So to me they're out of the running and I think they're a very important counterweight but they're not in this conversation. You have MAGA, let's just call it, with reach through the center and to some liberals who are now disaffected with what's happening with the left. And then you have the far right when we're talking about people who make their own weather, make things go viral, have posts regularly in the millions of views, are on podcast networks and have speak and speak directly and clearly with views and followers into younger generation. Those are the three groups right now. M >> and so I think that whichever group's going to tack more towards the middle of this is going to gather the 80% of Americans who in fact agree on everything. >> Really? Are you sure about this? I am seeing the dynamic going in the exact opposite direction. It feels to me like the more extreme you are, the more views you get, the more boosted your content is, the bigger the audience there is, the bigger the podcast you go on. Isn't that happening? >> That is absolutely happening. Maybe I maybe I didn't say it as clearly. Whoever can figure out how to do that and hold that center coalition right now instead of the sort of cheap junk food of the sides, that's where the majority of Americans are. >> I see. >> So if we can break out of this mind control, I did a set of polls. I was so you so push polling. You understand what that is? That's if you say, you know, I'm the most mad about Joe Biden's socialism for this, this, or this, where you're getting a poll to get the answers that you want so you can weaponize it. It's it's rampant. It's very hard to do good polling. And I have a bunch of team of polling of pollsters who I really really trust. And I want to do an experiment. So, I wrote a whole series of questions asking them in the least partisan, most open possible way about major topics. And I've talked about this at greater length before, but for instance, I believe in climate change. You know, maybe you get 55 60%. I believe climate change is a hoax. Maybe you get 40 45%. But instead, we wrote, I believe in clean fields and streams and skies and seas. Taking care of the environment is something we should do. 94% agreement. So if you are a leader who can understand right now that we're at a breaking point and people are exhausted with nihilism and despair and hopelessness and you can be a guiding light in that regard and approach issues from a point of consensus and a shared value set, that's what's moving everything the right way. And we've done testing to prove that. If you if you come with a shared set of core American values and you can establish that base and grow from there and we're seeing these tiny green shoots of it. Spencer Cox in Utah and um Wes Moore just did a did a commercial Democrat and Republican saying, you know, giving each other's names. We're friends. We disagree. Here we are on different things. Now they're not in a head-to-head race, but them just going on and being humanized. If we have those discussions, what happens is the whole populace can start to calm down. And what's happening is with mind control is I think we're in a suspended state of of the word trauma is so overused, but I don't think we're in real time. There's a psychological phrase about being in real time. I think that our nervous systems are hacked. Um there's something called family systems psychology that basically talks about families as closed systems. So a lot of times if you have you know most families have an identified um patient like the sick one the problematic one and one of the things you can see a lot is if that one gets well the next kid will go down or the next problem will go down or if that one dies because it it talks about anxiety being closed and system and families bind it in different ways >> and there's something called the Karpman drama triangle that's very very interesting and it talks about addiction loops and dysfunction loops >> and what it means when you're in a dynamic like this when someone's is the victim, someone's the savior, right? Someone's the persecutor. So Cartman has there's three different roles. There's victim, rescuer, and persecutor. All of those are bad roles. Okay? So the rescuer isn't really rescuing. What the rescuer is really doing is saying, you know, I'm I'm so pure and I'm so open-hearted and I have so much good that we don't even have to examine my shortcomings or willful blindness. I'm here. I'm just serving the victim. And then at some point the aggravation of the victim's unwillingness to heal gets so much they turn into a persecutor. And so the roles change >> and the victim role we're aware of how bad that is, right? You're you can be a victim, nothing's ever your fault. And but all of these roles shift and when you're in these roles, you're in a dynamic which means you're not existing in real time. You're not really looking that each person is filled with nuance and contains multitudes and we all can be all these things. And what is actually the thing that's going to break the cycle and move us out from that into transformational change away from addiction, away from bad family dynamics. The news cycle right now, I see people constantly persisting where we have political leaders who are and and influencers who are the biggest victims in the world and then they're the biggest rescuers in the world and then they're the biggest persecutors in the world and we're moving between these roles which aren't real and the only way to shatter them as you're saying those can get a lot of views. they can get a lot of following. And if we keep going this way, one side or the other is going to win. And that means we're back in that proverbial car with somebody stomped on the brakes or somebody stomped on the gas. And if we want to gather the majority of Americans who are outside these outsiz radical voices on the left that are exhibiting control mostly by threatening immense reputational and financial damage to people, right? That's mob control and cancellation. If we can crack through to that, there's a chance to break the dynamic. And there's a chance to actually focus and clear our heads and look at the chessboard before us and say, \"Here's where we are in America. Here's what we need to do for our kids. Here's how the chessboard exists right now in the world with Russia and China and the Islamic Republic and President Trump. And oh, here's a here's a Gaza peace plan that seems insane and unlikely. Maybe that's something that we support even if we have criticisms about him domestically. And here's something on our own side which is fairly vile and reprehensible.\" It's very difficult to do that when you're only convinced that the other side wants to kill you and both sides are convinced that the other side wants to kill you and we're in scared traumatic postures that we're struggling to break through. >> One of my goals for 2026 is to feel in control of my money.

There is one thing that makes me think that is an important factor that we haven't discussed which is what's happening in the real world particularly the ever growing gap between rich and poor. We've seen right the way through history the moment people feel that they no longer can afford basic necessities. When the when life is becoming more and more difficult that's when they tend to gravitate towards populism whether it's left or it's rightwing. And we've seen if go back to those three groups you pointed out the far right MAGA and also the far left. The far left are talking about economic inequality which is a very real issue. The Mandanis the Bernie Sanders they have a point. I don't agree with their policies but they have a point in pointing it out. >> Can I tell you just real quick? >> Yeah. >> That there's a flaw in that with them because they don't talk about economic injustice. They talk about economic inequality and the opposite of that is economic equality. M and even they don't want that. >> Yeah. >> So proceed. >> Yeah. Okay. So you've got MAGA. >> Yeah. >> But this is how the majority of people see it. MAGA, one of the one of their key policies was we need to bring back the jobs that have been lost through globalization. We need to bring them back to America. America first. And the far right are touching on it as well in their own way. So I think that's one of the things we also need to talk about is economic inequality, particularly how it radicalizes populations, but in particular young men if they feel they've got no opportunity or no chance to actually move forward, have a family, buy a place, etc. >> Exactly. And they can't take any pride in who they are and who their their ancestors are. Right. >> We all want that. M >> so that's that's a that's a very important point. There's two statistics I think more than any other that describe the state that we're in right now when we talk about the problems that we're facing. One of them is that since Reagan 50 to 60 trillion dollars with a T has moved from the bottom 90% of Americans to the top 1% of Americans. One of the problems with that is it didn't move that way through a free market. M >> they move that way due to regulatory capture and excessive lobbyism. Big pharma has I think it's 3.5 lobbyists per member of Congress. >> That's a rigged game. >> So we can't look at it and say of course we love capitalism and free markets because that was rigged. That's $50 trillion from the bottom 90 to the top 1%. The other statistic is for the past decades the correlation between public support and desire for a bill to be passed and the bill actually passing is 0%. So people walking around outraged, nihilistic, upset don't know those statistics, but they feel those statistics. They know them to be true. Even if that's not an analysis that they've done. >> And while those things happen, when we talk about, oh my god, you know, the democracy is being shattered or this crisis is happening or there's war in the Middle East or what's happening with Russia, they don't care. Everything's broken already. And one of the effects of the online world is is that we can't talk about those things clearly. And so what you see is when every when any issue gets politicized, everyone loses. >> Abortion, immigration, anti-semitism, you go down the list. Once it's political, it's being gamed. >> And that is part of the thing that we have to break because there's very real discussions that we have to have that involve, okay, how are we going to put jobs back in the place? How is the government going to partner with private industry? I you know I got one of the things that happens when you explore new spaces is Jordan says at times the fool precedes the master right and so if you go into more spaces you're a fool more and more and I I've had you know a great number of those moments but one of them I was on a call with a um a prominent Republican um congressman and we were talking about regulations. This was years ago and I was kind of beating the drums on this and he said, \"You liberals think every time that we want to roll back regulations, it's cuz we want to dump toxins in rivers and I just laughed.\" He goes, \"What are you laughing at?\" I go, \"You're totally right. I have the I have like a third grade understanding of this.\" And he was like, \"Here's how you have to work with private business. It takes six or seven years to build an off-ramp in New York. This is untenable. Here's codified corruption.\" >> And so I went I went off, you know, and educated myself a lot on that. I talked to people who were in infrastructure. We ran studies. I did a podcast that Jordan graciously invited me on to with somebody who's an expert in infrastructure. You have to go forth and recognize when you hit a wall and something doesn't make any sense because your presuppositions are still old. And we have to be able to accommodate and assimilate. I mean, that's the base level, you know, Pia with the stages of childhood development. Every stage we accommodate and assimilate information. And when the stakes are made way too high for somebody to say, \"Well, maybe I'm wrong, but I'm not comfortable talking about Israel right now and I feel like I'll get yelled at.\" And if we say, \"You're a monster and you need to be removed and deported.\" >> We're not leaving people room to negotiate ideas around gender, around anti-semitism, around immigration, around abortion. And if and a leader needs to be somebody who makes those conversations safe to have and the ways that we're fighting about the issu the very real issues you're talking about. If we look at how those are being discussed, >> they are in a very your side's wrong, my side's right and absolutely right mode and nothing gets solved that way because reality is where ideology goes to die. >> Um I want to say something back to you. you you you had a piece that I that I came across um either serendipitously or because my phone's listening to me and knew I was driving to talk to you guys where you were talking about this dialing up the crazy and you said something very astute that I think is very important which is it's not Jeff Bezos's fault if you're radicalized, >> right? It's not all it's not your guy's fault if somebody has the situation wrong. We all have to make our individual choices of what news that we consume. We are the drivers of this. We there's nothing more powerful than where we put our attention. And if we're choosing to eat a diet of junk food and on boarding and it's on boarding, like if you study, you know, let's say that you're a young man and you go on because you want to look up your family ancestry and then you're being onboarded to street fights and then it's race baiting and then it's a diet of neo-Naziism. There's there's these onboarding structures that are insane. >> But we somehow have lost the locust of ourselves. And why I'm saying that isn't to scold, but to say there's something incredibly empowering when we say, \"I'm going to fix things in reality around me. I'm going to fix what I look at, what my kids look at, and I'm also going to solve problems that aren't so far out of reach that I can't possibly find them because by design, that's made for me to feel desparing and paralyzed, right? How do I fix the environment? You can't. >> Right? Oh my god, these the these healthc care for veterans just got cut. What do I do? Well, do you know a restaurant that is open to the cause? Do you know college students who will volunteer? Do you have some veterans in your community who need this? Solve the problem. we're empowered and more and more people are saying I'm frozen in despair >> or what they're saying is the game is rigged your game. >> Yes, >> that's what I think of it and that's where I get really concerned because you have this anger particularly from young men and as we all know young men are the ones that are going to be more likely to be extreme. You look at the Luigi Manion case. Case in point, anger, frustration for whatever reason. Here's my target. There you go. That's right. So CS Lewis, uh, in Screw Tape Letters, he has this great line, which I'll hopefully not paraphrase too widely, where he says, you know, he's he's it's it's a letter from a demon who's advising somebody on how to corrupt the mind of a human of a man on earth to claim him for the underworld. And he says, \"Keep him constantly obsessed and focused on the state of his mother's soul, but never on her rheumatoid arthritis.\" >> The more we can be worried of the abstract, I'm a voice who's going to save, you know, I'm going to have peace in the Middle East. I'm going to solve environmentalism by taping my hands to the Mona Lisa. I'm here. I'm I'm I'm solving things for the world. the further removed we are from our locus of control which gives us meaning and which gives us choices and which gives us power >> and part of when when the way you broke that down about the news consumption diet I I go back often as I know you you both do to Sultzan who wrote of course the goolog archipelago which I think in a lot of ways was the moral argument that brought down the Soviet Union and his question dying of cancer in a goolog was what are all the ways I contributed to me being here what are all the times I didn't speak up when somebody did this bit of language control or somebody informed on a neighbor, how did I go along with this? And I think he's a wonderful counterpoint to the great man theory of history where we're waiting for our next great man. We're waiting for our next great leader um bless you who's going to come and save and vanquish us. And part of it is is we all stitch the fabric of the culture together around us. We all have a role in that. And when it disintegrates, I mean, one of the things Sultzene said was that basically everyone in a totalitarian society lies about everything all the time. >> And that act of setting ourselves in order or saying, you know, I have a >> uh anyways, we don't need to deal >> I talked to so many people as I know you do who are so desparing and it's almost like they lose agency to fix a problem in their backyard with their kid, their kid's friend, with a neighbor, some small effort you make in your community. And we can keep trying to look for bigger and systemic changes, but we have to relocate that within ourselves. >> And it's also as well politicians really. And look, MAGA said they're going to, so let's see what they're doing. And they're trying the tariff thing in order to bring jobs back to America. I really worry about this generation, Greg. This particularly the young the young generation. There's a sense of hopelessness amongst them that we simply didn't feel at that age. >> No, we didn't. Imagine if we were going to school when we were 12 and our parents said, \"Okay, here's this little device you're going to take with you. It contains unlimited pornography. It contains unlimited fights and violence. Also, Kmeni can tweet at you during the day or any other group. Have this in your pocket. It can be in your in your desk at school. It can be in your locker. It's in the bathroom. Go have a good life.\" 12-year-old with no mileinated prefrontal cortex. we'd be gone. And increasingly as and and for this I I put the weight much more squarely on the left. This removal of the canon, this removal of the fact that there's a different established set of ways that we teach and learn in the world is absolutely brutal because if you sever people off from a colonialist past and you don't read Orwell and you don't read Duffyki and you're not reading Plato or Socrates, fill in the blank. If you're not reading Frederick Douglas, if you're not reading and understanding the actual civil rights movement and how the basis of that was in responsibility and accountability, not in whatever is passing for some versions of activism we're seeing today, then everything's new again. >> Well, you mentioned some versions of activism. One of the things we talked about before we started is how do you do something that's effective? And there are a lot of organizations, I mean the ADL is just one example, which you found seems to want to quote unquote fight anti-semitism, but actually it's very ineffective and in fact sometimes making things worse, right? >> Yeah. Well, I've done a lot of analysis with a group. I have a partner group called um NCRI, which is the network contagion res research institute and we look at different plannings. I believe it's unequivocal that DI and oppression and anti-semitism and microaggression training not only is ineffective but that it drives the opposite effect. I believe that that is >> I believe it's beyond debate. That's a very I shouldn't say that everything's open to debate. I believe that that a proper debate on this with experts on both sides who know more than I do from both sides. everything that I've seen that is a that that to me is an issue that is provable. >> We looked at the types of training statistics and statements from the Anti-Defamation League and one of the outcomes we saw was it drove 15x greater anti-semitic responses. People felt more hostile. They felt irritated. And the thing is that's really and and by the way we did a a test where we exposed we looked at 30 different admission standards from everything from Canada to Harvard to Colombia to the UN to the state department that looked at this anti-opression training network and the results there were were absolutely stunning. We saw 35% of people and we had control groups. 35% of people saw bias after a control where they saw none after this training that there was more. 25% thought that damage had been done to the student when before they thought there was none. And 24% thought that the admissions officer or the interviewer had acted with violence against them. And then the punitive numbers of whether that person should be reprimanded went up double digits across the boards. And we did a similar thing where we did training, you know, we we had one people read an essay on corn and other people read an essay on on again anti-opression training. Let me use that as the umbrella term that everyone's an oppressor or victim, which is a huge problem because I don't want to be an oppressor or a victim. Like there's no good role there. You're an oppressor, a victim, or a persecutor on the side of good. >> None of those roles are good. And we and then afterwards we replaced Hitler's speeches using the cast system in India instead of Hitler's terms so that they were less familiar to Americans and we saw 25% of people would view the other group as parasitical who needed to be destroyed. So anytime you identify this and I did some a fairly set of deep dives around the explosion of anti-semitism after October 7th. Anytime that you identify a group as its own separate group and then you're beating your chest around grievance around that group, it drives more disdain, hatred, uh, defensiveness and aggression towards that group. And we know this and it's fixable. And >> how do you fix it? >> You tack to universal values. Another thing we did in the control group was because we were dealing with anti-semitism in one instance, we exposed people to just tenants of Judaism. Here's basic rules of Judaism, shared universal values that were American. All of a sudden, we're seeing double digits in the 20s of positive responses that go the other way. And so what's very important is, and I've I've done some talk with with Jewish institutions and Jewish groups and orgs as best as I can, which is to say, look, 52% of people in America don't feel that they can openly talk about anti-semitism or Israel or Jews or Israel right now. That's really bad. We don't want to keep foreclosing that because what you foreclose, you make forbidden and what you make forbidden becomes taboo and what becomes taboo becomes sacred and alluring. And so we need to actually do the opposite, which is okay, if you hate Jews, if you have a view, this particular view on immigration, if you have whatever, you're allowed to have that. What you can't do is stop traffic and make true threats and destroy property and shut down universities and commit violent acts. And so there's a distinction between what are what are, you know, violent words and violent thoughts, let's say, not words that encourage active violence, which is illegal, and what we're going to do about it. But the reaction is the opposite, which is to say, look, you know, for a a Jewish group, for let's say it's a group of of people with different sexual orientation, Harvey Mil, >> the pathway he laid out, the pathway laid out by Frederick Douglas through John Lewis and the civil rights movement, the pathways that are laid out with different groups saying we only want the same sort of rights and safety around us as every other group has, and our core values are in fact aligned with core core American values or if you're in a western country, core western values. And that's okay. That goes back to the Greeks and the Romans because those values are the ones that set the conditions to allow the center to hold and the fringe to thrive. >> They're the only ones that do that. And that there is a language for how the fringe needs to exist and how it negotiates and how the center can't get too rigid. And we need to be able to have that balance back. And we've done this forever. So, a shared set of values that uplifts everybody as opposed to a continuous disintegration. You've you've talked I I think I don't know if you've had Jonathan Pio on the podcast. We've >> overlap. We're friends. >> Jonathan is a is a stunningly deep thinker and he talks about how one of his lectures is he talks about how a symbol is something that unites and upholds. And what the word diabolical actually means is to disintegrate into pieces. That's what diabolical means. Zero sum of like well, you know, do we need it to be how many points of intersectionality do we line up to have rights that are different from everybody else? It's not going to get us there. What are the rights that we share? And the other thing I will say just while we're talking about this is we don't have time anymore, I believe, to continue on a path of comparative grievance. And that's not something I'm limiting only to the left either. There's all sorts of tribal grievance that is happening right now. China is building 33 large nuclear reactors. Nuclear reactors. I mean, the energy war is on. That's what's going to power AI. That's what's going to power drone warfare. We have seen from Ukraine that drone warfare is going to be everything. America now has zero in production. Okay, that's a tiny little microcosm of what we're looking at. If we are negotiating backwards and and we're not going to have time in full to have more fundraisers and more elections and then these guys are going to win without being corrupted and then at the midterms they're going to get control without being corrupted and they're going to pass the magical laws and then we're going to reach a new utopia that's going to come in. We have to deal with the real world in real time. And that means that we have to look forward and we have to look at the chess board before us now. And I think that the stuff that's trying to move backwards and is moving us into grievance that has to be cleared and negotiated before we'll do deal in any way with anybody else around us and join those resources that we need, conservative and liberal, the more problems we're going to have in the world. And we're not going to be able to keep up with countries that don't need to have this kind of negotiation because they don't care about free speech and they care way less about women's rights and minority rights than we do. >> Which is why going back to in economic inequality to me it's such a huge issue. We had Barry Strauss on the show. We've had him twice and we're going to have him again. He's a brilliant, brilliant his ancient historian. And he said one of the main reasons why ancient Rome fell was a growing disparity between rich and poor. Because when the poor feel that they can't have access to society, that they can't buy property or whatever it may be that they are essentially third or fourth class citizens. >> Then why are they going to v why are they going to fight for a country? Why are they going to be part of a society if they feel that they have no chance of being part of that society? So this is why I think more and more we talk about race in America. We talk about all of these different issues. To me, this is the number one thing. We America really does need to solve this because you need to have people who are prepared to fight and die for this country. And that traditionally that ain't the middle class. That ain't the wealthy. That's a blueco collar guys and girls. There's an amazing amount of arrogance that happened. You know, again, I hate using terms like the elite. We have so many terms that are captured and that's actually part of the Orwellian game. So, I don't mean that in a, you know, >> screamy manner. But I do think that there's been a real separation from the people who keep the country running and moving, who are building things in the world and laying pipes and extracting oil and can keep the country running. You can't denigrate them with faculty lounge research and terms and handpack all of their their notions and their use of language. Mhm. >> There's an enormous embodiment of wisdom in common sense and we I think that's something that we've really forgotten and there's been a lot of arrogance and I think one of the things that's happening with an AI revolution right now is a lot of jobs that are previously sort of Tony jobs that you're well taken care of are going to get eaten by AI. And like if you want to be a, you know, millionaire in America right now, if you're an electrician, if you're a elevator repairman, if you're a plumber with a fleet of cars, like vans, those are going to be really good bets. And for some reason, we thought that the people who are who are down with their hands in the dirt where theories have to meet reality, you need a crew. It doesn't matter if your crew's top value is inclusion, empathy, or some loyalty test to a party. What matters is they can get the job done and they're conscientious. And the further we get removed from this, the worse shape we are. >> And look, the other thing I like so much about dealing with problems in reality and fixing them is every time I've done that, so many of my suppositions are wrong, first of all. >> And you know, one of the things that that I was counseledled on enough to take really seriously was the majority of interventions in the culture make things worse. And if you want to make things better, you have to operate and deal with them in reality. Well, in reality, almost all your notions of the world are are confused and out the window if you're trying to get a measurable income. And it's very it's very humbling to try to make something work, a b a small business, a venture, anything to build or do something in the real world. It's a process of undeceiving. But the other thing is in conflict resolution, one of the things you do is there's all these great programs where like if you're trying to get two gangs to stop having violence on the street is you take them away in a different context. >> You go out in the woods somewhere, you chop up the teams and then you play capture the the flag with the teams mixed in different ways. And the more we can do this with smaller strike teams, both politically, both within the kinds of ways that you guys try to have these different voices where someone comes on and you're like, \"Well, Sam just said this last week, but here's somebody who's more conservative, has this view.\" The more we can get people working together in something that's in the real world that's bent at fixing real things or that is based on cooperation, that's how these things fix. They don't fix from training. They don't fix by talking to your prefrontal cortex to tell you about what in-group favoritism looks like and why that's offensive and what microaggressions look like in your face when you're an eight-year-old boy. >> It's way too abstract. >> And so when we get to fixing things, and that's why I have a sort of continued I I'm continuing to implore that we look at reality condition to condition to condition. You can be as mad at Trump as you want about a bunch of things, but it is important to look and to acknowledge, hey, wait a minute, he just raised sanctions on Russia and now China has stepped away and um India has stepped away and that seems to be having a positive effect. And as Americans with an American president who's leading in the world, those are probably things that we want to have because that's a peaceful resolution to a conflict that's killing now in the millions of people, >> right? We have to be able to separate and look at that and hold another thought in our head which is, \"Oh, but I find this thing over here with the administration problematic.\" Guess what? Everything's problematic. We're humans. Our institutions are corrupt. People are corrupt. Everything is a mess. And if we can look in reality and see what impact our choices are having and where to criticize and where to view with nuance, I think we can start to go a much longer way instead of, you know, front towards enemy at all times, no matter what happens. Well, one of the things for that to happen, I think, is you have to make certain changes to the way our social media algorithms are are operating. And you've written quite a bit on some of the solutions around that. So, as we wrap up, can you give us the basic Greg's plan on how to solve social media? >> Yeah. Well, let's see. It's a it's a it's a a tentative step in the right direction. I don't know about solving, but the first thing is is I do think we need algorithms to be transparent. >> Mh. And you know, I know there's a lot of complication around what's proprietary that people can steal, but we need independent groups. Like what we want isn't to control freedom of speech. What we want is more transparency. Right now in every field across the country, there's massive distrust. And the only solution to distrust is transparency because you need truth first before you can have reconciliation. You don't ever get to reconciliation without truth. So freedom of speech is not freedom of reach for profit. That's not what freedom of speech means. It doesn't mean that you can distort this through psychopathic algorithms, bad faith players, and hostile foreign regimes. We need to know, and the free market needs to know, and advertisers need to know, and parents need to know, what are we looking at, and why are we looking at it? If I do nothing but put your attention on interracial fights in cities for 24 hours, you're going to come out thinking things differently. What is the aim of that? So, we need to have those um that are transparent and can also be assessed. And the other thing I like about that is leaving aside obviously the illegal, but we want people to dip into ideas that are maybe dangerous or menacing or fringe >> by their own choice. We don't want it governed by, you know, some uber agency what people can look at or can't look at short of the illegal because those interventions into darker corners, they should be inoculative. Right? They shouldn't be um deranging. And so if you know what's where, I mean, we've all, you know, we had this in contacts. I was talking about our phones with how phones work. Well, there's certain books we could get. There's certain things we could get when we were younger, but they weren't everywhere all the time being fed to us. >> Other thing is is I do believe that we should privilege people who use their real name in their communications online. That doesn't mean that you get rid of people who are anonymous. you there's whistleblower accounts, but there's there's all sorts of everything else. But if you're going to say something and stand behind that with your own name in a way, maybe there's a first tier of engagement that happens on social media platforms and everyone else can be here and you can go sift down here and things can be borrowed from there and you can go explore all you want. But real people who are using their real voices should and having some courage and some accountability and some um reputational um force that they're standing behind should have some modum of of privilege within the system >> because anonymity breeds toxic behavior. Yeah. >> In the same way that when we're driving a car and someone cuts in front of us, it's much easier to flip them the bird. I would not flip you the bird right now for the same in the same situation. >> Yeah, there's no there's zero cost to being as reprehensible as possible. >> All right. >> Um and then the other thing I would say is a we also need to have we we can't get rid of um human involvement and interference. There's a lot of like well we have the software that analyzes what's legal or not and it takes you know 50 days to do a review of what is and isn't. We need some human decency and some human common sense and some people have to make that decision. I've long thought that that you two would be really good arbiters of this. You know, if there's like a I I don't know what exactly the process is, but to have arbiters of what constitutes legitimate um discourse and what can just be common sensical to say that's clearly is geared for hellacious aims. We can't act as if everything can be AI assessing what AI is because there's infinite ways to game at. So, don't be afraid of human judgment. We've used human judgment our whole lives. Um, and the other thing I would say is we should identify and eliminate inauthentic content. If there's a bot swarm that's initiated, and we've seen this around hate speech that's gotten initiated, um, around debates, I've tracked this, you know, at different times for Jordan, for Douglas Murray when things go. Sometimes 35% of it is false or 35% of it is from foreign regimes or is sourced outside the United States. Well, we should know that. We should know when there's a paper tiger effect because one of the aims of on boarding with hateful dangerous narrative is to create that permission structure. That's why Russian agents, for instance, went to France and they painted Stars of David on Jewish houses and synagogues so it just looked like anti-semitism was everywhere so you can on board it more. Well, we don't need that. Nobody needs that. Advertisers don't need it. Social media doesn't need it. So, if it's a bot swarm and inauthentic stuff of one person who's sitting in a troll farm in Moscow, we should be able to identify that and call it what it is. Freedom of speech does not mean unlimited access for foreign adversaries who want to divide and destroy us to speak to our youngest people. That's not what freedom of speech is about. >> It's also suicidal. >> Greg, it's been a brilliant interview. Thank you so much. Final question is always the same. What's the one thing that we're not talking about that we really should be? that we that there's been a disconnection between I think the secular and the symbolic world and wisdoms and and means and methods of making meaning and that those two things have come apart and I think right now we're at a process of trying to to reintegrate those two schools of thought of how people think and I'm saying symbolically that can be mythologically archetypally narratively religiously >> and a secular sort of more you know intensely factbased approach. These two modes of thinking are almost entirely disconnected. And when you're in one, it's very hard to understand and comprehend what the other is saying. We need a lot of translation and a lot of understanding. Um, and those two things need to continue to be in conversation and feathered back together in the way that they have been in the past. >> All right, Greg, thank you so much for coming on. Head on over to substack triggerpod.co.uk where we ask Greg your questions. Is there any evidence that any part of the political left, including the media and movie studios, have taken any responsibility or feel any guilt or regret about legitimizing violence against conservatives?"

    "transcript": "What's interesting as well is how comedians try and censor [music] other comedians. >> Jokes about jokes about uh disabled people. >> Peter Phyillas >> right up my alley. >> You've got more skeletons in your closet than Halloween. And then you're going to go, you know who's really moral? This guy. >> You don't really have that here as much. >> Yet now there's nothing you can talk about that isn't political. [music] Every female comic I know is bisexual, but they're not. all women somehow are on the same team, which I've never experienced. [laughter] >> I'd imagine if you laid out a reasonable person's thoughts, you'd have things in all these different categories. [music] However, if it's all on the left, you're like, how is it conveniently all on the left? And same with all the right. Like, the odds of that are preposterous. He's inarguably funny. I don't know if I want him to be. I don't know if it's a good thing. >> Jeff, welcome to trigonometry. >> Thanks for having me, boys. Well, it's great to have you on, man. I'm We're big fans. You're you're hilarious. Your stuff is great. Comes up on my social feeds all the time. >> Uh tell us a little bit about you, like your story. Who are you? >> Um I was born in Kent, Washington. That's a a little woods town, a little bluecollar town south of Seattle, Washington. And uh I was like a class clown and a goofball. And all I ever wanted to be was a comedian. Well, I guess I wanted to be a baseball player, but that wasn't that [laughter] wasn't in the cards. And I knew that even while that was happening. Uh and then from from there I moved up to Seattle after high school to become a comedian and that's what I've been ever since. >> That Seattle pretty short. >> Yeah. I mean that is a good summation. Se was Seattle as mental as it is now. >> No it wasn't. And that's why I used to love Seattle my entire life and why I still root for their sports teams. But now I'm always like I'm from Kent. I'm not [laughter] from Seattle is because Seattle used to be at least in my memory. So this some people might hear this and go, \"What is he talk?\" This was just my experience. Seattle was artistic and like fun and like we had all these hippies. We had all these weirdos. We had all these like progressives and artists who were like progressive sexually and they're progressive artistically. They were all the things you see now, but they were nice about it. They were hippies. They weren't angry hipsters. Now those same types are very angry and very political and very socialist and very like >> it's just it's the same stuff but angry and that's what I don't like. >> And it's such a good point because I remember growing up around those people and being kind of part of those people in my late teens, early 20s, you know, and you you hang out and you know they talk and you know it'd be nonsense. You're wearing a Sha t-shirt and he kind of executed gay people, but let's not focus on that. But we didn't even know that. You just go, \"I've seen that shit.\" Yeah. It was like Darth Vader. >> Yeah. Exactly. Cool cheekbones. What does it mean? Don't worry about it. But but and then it just went weird. >> Yeah. >> And then it got really angry. Like before I always wanted to go to Seattle, you know, the Jimmyi Hendris Museum, the design of the museum on fire. And now you're like >> I like will I get killed? >> Right. I know. And that's it feels militant. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. It feels very militant. And it's also like I remember when I being a young straight white guy and thinking has >> that changed? >> No. [laughter] No. Still still those things, but as a well I'm not young anymore I guess. But I remember like seeing like those progressives and the artists and the poets and the comedians and musicians and thinking I want to be like them. >> Yeah. >> Now I see them and I'm I want to cross the street. I'm annoyed by them. >> And so that's the only difference is that like they they they don't they don't feel like something I want to be a part of anymore. And you've moved to LA to get away from all that. [laughter] >> Yeah. Yeah. I used to joke that I I moved from Seattle to Los Angeles, so I didn't meet a Republican till I was like 34. [laughter] Republicans were like Bigfoot to me. I was like, \"What? You saw one? Are they as strong as I've heard?\" Uh yeah, it wasn't uh it wasn't a thing necessarily to be like a conservative. It wasn't popular or cool, you know? And uh not that it is now either, but I don't know. Like Seattle's just changed in that way. >> But I don't get that read from you anyway. I don't get that you're a conservative. I just think you're someone who's like thinking and seeing the world more as it is as opposed to through these ideological filters which is what comedian kind of supposed to do. Right. >> Exactly. Well, I like to think that like if you laid out everyone's political thoughts, uh, they would be all over because everyone tries to go, well, I'm not a Trumper, but I'm conservative or I'm not, uh, I I'm I'm left-leaning, but I'm not all the way over here, you know, trans ideologist. Everyone wants to be the reasonable thing. They're always claiming they're the reasonable thing. So, I'd imagine if you laid out a reasonable person's thoughts, you'd have things in all these different categories. However, a red flag should be when you only have things in one category. Like, like if you if you can everything goes down the list, you should probably wonder where you're getting your news and where your what your real thoughts are. >> That's a really good point, man. That's a really good point. >> If it's all on the left, you're like, how is it conveniently all on the left? And same with all the right. Like how could you have all those ideas be the same? Like the odds of that are preposterous, >> right? Well, especially when you often find I think it's f like when we won Rogan just a few weeks ago we he showed this clip of a guy who goes to an anti-ICE protest and talks about human rights and he's like you believe in human rights, right? Right. And they're all like, \"Yeah, yeah. What about the unborn?\" Like because >> Yeah. >> both sides have contradictory ideas and these like little dark areas that they don't want to look into. cuz it's inconvenient to the party line >> 100%. >> So if you think for yourself, you're probably never going to be all one side or the other >> and it annoys my fans cuz uh some of my fans think because I'm on Gutfeld or Fox that I have to have the thoughts of everything on the right. So if I make a poke or a jab at something that doesn't perfectly fit into that, they're like, \"What? He shouldn't be on here anymore.\" And you're like, \"No, I'm not. I'm fighting against that.\" I am like leaning very right these days. But it's only cuz society is cuz societ that's what's most reasonable right now and and by their opinion or their definition of what is right. >> Well, this is what I always say to people about my views as well. It's exactly the same which is like if the car is heading down the road, but instead of heading down the middle of the road, it is steering way the to the left and is about to crash. Well, you yank it to the right. Absolutely. Don't you? So it's if you believe that you want the car to be going down the middle, that doesn't mean you're always going to be pulling in this direction that because it's really about where the rest of the society is 100%. >> And if you think about like I think we're similar age the stuff that is going on now, how crazy it would have sounded. >> Yes. >> Even to the far left 20 years ago, >> all this stuff about like open borders like Bernie Sanders. >> That's insane. >> It's insane. >> Yeah. I have a joke uh that I used to like I don't even remember what the bit was but if I could sense that the audience was even pulling back I would go listen stop for a second if I was standing on this exact stage 10 years ago and I told you men could have babies you would think I was the stupidest person you've ever heard and now you're sitting in those exact chairs acting like you've always thought this so either A you don't really believe what you claim you believe or b your ideas have changed also So, this is a new idea even for you. Even you would have to admit that you've adopted the idea that you've always believed men could have babies. You didn't always think that. That's preposterous. >> And so, I'm always kind of like pushing on that kind of stuff. >> And it's not just as well being a comedian, it's not just as well like your audience because everything is super polarized and you know, you know what the algorithm is. You know what the algorithm likes. the more you, you know, the more you go to one side and it's spicy, the better it's going to do, whether it's left spicy or right spicy. >> Right. >> But what's interesting as well is how comedians try and censor other comedians. >> Never seen it till recently. Like I've I've I've heard about it, but I've never witnessed it till now. Right. >> Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's like this is far more prevalent in the UK. So, Zoran got elected got elected obviously, and I put out a tweet which is New York is a city that never sleeps. Uh, and the reason for that is, uh, Zoran's just brought in a 5 a.m. pray call to prayer. >> That's great. >> Yeah. And then >> that's more of a Yeah, that's that's a that's a kind of a cheeky That's kind of like a clean joke. >> Yeah. [laughter] >> Really? Yeah. >> And I've had comedians go, \"Francis, what the hell are you doing? What are you Why are you saying this stuff?\" Because you know it's seen as like you can't joke about certain things because if you do >> that means that you're bigoted. So like for instance you can take the piss out of Christians but you can't take the piss out of Islam >> which is preposterous. >> And the thing that I love about America is you don't really have that here as much >> yet. It's coming. >> Is it? >> It feels like it's coming. I mean look at Canada. I mean, look at like it's that's right above us. I mean, and like look what's going on in New York. I mean, like I feel like we're on unless we can really make some dramatic changes uh in social opinions or or or common think like then then I think it's coming. But I I love that joke and I like that idea. Like that that's a very like funny thing. Did you ever think we would be in a time where Anthony Jezelnik is publicly saying what comics should and shouldn't be joking about? >> The guy has 60 minutes about killing kids and babies, but then is mad that like a comic would have a politician on his podcast or would do a joke about gay or trans people. Mark Marin is now policing what comics should and shouldn't say. And instead of saying that he's clutching his pearls and instead of these comics acting like it it's a PC thing, instead they just call it hack. They go, \"Well, it's hack.\" You're like, \"Well, it's you can be hack. That's not against the rules. We're allowed to be hack. If you want to call it hack, call it hack.\" But what you're really doing is you're virtue signaling and you're pretending like uh that these comics shouldn't be saying it by masking it as saying it's hack, but really you're offended. >> Yeah. >> That that like that, you know, these that we're joking about subjects that you don't like. It's so weird as well because we had the s the same thing happen in the UK but like a good five six years ago when Frankie Bole I don't know if you know him Frankie Bole was a giant in British comedy with the most offensive jokes >> okay >> jokes about rape jokes about uh disabled [laughter] >> pedophilious >> right up my alley >> everything right >> and then I think what happened is he got cancelled for something >> okay >> and he came back and He became this the most woke person you've ever met. He he had an entire show that you just you basically get [ __ ] social justice activists on to give a half an hour round pretending it's comedy. And I don't what I don't understand is do they not see that given their particular type of comedy. You're talking about Jezel Nick as well like you have no legs to stand on when it comes to this. >> Well that's I mean it's funny the second you said that I started thinking about Howard Stern. Howard Stern as a the longest list of of sins when it comes to being politically correct, right? >> You can find him saying the n-word, hard R, like hundreds of times on the internet. >> You can see him dressing up in blackface. You can see him doing all the things that he would be against. He used to have uh escorts and prostitutes, I don't even know the term, sex workers, whatever it is, every single day on his thing, community, all this stuff. Uh, and now he's super woke. Neil deGrasse Tyson all of a sudden is a scientist who doesn't want to talk about gender or talk about any of these what we used to call biology and it's because he got in trouble. You know, I wonder if that's maybe the motivation of all these people to all of a sudden become this super PC woke person just for their own I don't know. I mean, do you think that that's a possibility or like why would this guy do that? >> Well, you tell me. I don't know if you if if this is replicated here in the US, but I will tell you when I used to do standup on the British comedy circuit, if you watch if you're standing backstage in the green room watching someone on stage and they bang on about how great a feminist they are. >> Yeah. >> They are a sleas bag. 100%. They are groping the other female comics in the in the green room. You know what? >> Yeah. I I don't know anyone that's ever talked to me about being a good feminist [laughter] ever for even longer than a minute. Uh but that's that makes total sense. It is something there's something suspicious about it. Uh uh anybody trying to like anyone trying to pretend they're good actually is kind of suspicious. Like most people are like uh they've been humbled and they go h you know I've made a lot of mistakes. You know that that's a better way to live your life than pretending that you're like so open-minded and great and all these I don't know. It's strange. >> Yeah. Especially for a comedian. >> Yeah. >> Do you know what? I've never met a comedian and you go you know what that dude's got his life together. >> He a standup guy, right? Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. >> Yeah. And all of a sudden you're going to go on a podcast and preach to people about how to behave. >> Yeah. It's very strange. >> It's like come on, man. Like >> And socially, not even just like like they're not even saying that like how they should behave or you should behave, but how society should be like that's crazy to me. >> Yeah. And it's like and the I I kind of admire the balls of it. Do you know what I mean? Cuz you've got more skeletons in your closet than Halloween >> and then you're going to go, you know who's really moral? This guy. And you're just thinking, my man, like you've just put a massive target on your back. >> Absolutely. >> And if there's one thing we know about women, they don't forget. >> Yeah. No, that's a fact. And the internet doesn't forget either way. Like that's a strange thing, >> you know. So, you've just made yourself an absolute target. Particularly, as we all know, there are certain comedians, they're great comics, not good people. >> Not good people. And but that was accepted. >> That was accepted. Louis CK was telling us that he was a sexual deviant since the day he became a public figure. Like you can find a long track record of him. He's like, \"I bought this violin and then I jacked off on it and I [laughter] like just crazy stuff.\" And then you find out that he was masturbating on the phone with a lady or something. And then then now he can't work. >> Yeah. >> And you're like, \"But he's been telling us the whole time he's he's a human. He's a flawed individual.\" Yeah. >> Yeah. And but the thing with Louis is like Louie never pretended to be a good person. >> I know. That's why I like him so much. That's why he's like my hero cuz it's like he goes, \"I'm flawed. >> You're flawed.\" Like this is, you know. >> So, you growing up where you grew up near Seattle at the very least. Do you have any thoughts on like how we got here or how this whole thing came into being? Cuz it is so different to the way things were even 20 years ago. >> You mean like politically, socially, all that? >> See, I don't you know, I people think we're like really interested in politics, but I don't think this is about politics. I think this is about culture. >> Sure. It's about social whatever like the group think of society, you know. >> Well, my answer I am going to present to you more as like just here's what I think. I'm not that uh firm on it and also I could be swayed and >> I I'm just chewing on it as I say it. So keep that in mind for your listeners. But I think it's an overcorrection. I I think what's happening is when I was in school learning about the civil rights and when I was in school learning about American history, a tremendous amount of shame, I would go, \"Oh man, that's wrong.\" But I had like an a young brain about it. So I thought like, I must be the bad person. I must have done these things. I longed to be the guy who was the white guy marching with the the black people of the civil rights. I wanted to be that guy. Like that guy's on the right. He was on the right side of history and he was doing a good thing. and and uh or I I would like to think that I would never do that to like a Native American, you know, it's very simple brained thoughts about these complicated subjects. And I think that you start to like then bash yourself, you know, you start to go like, ah, shame on white people and shame on this thing. And it's such an oversimplification, you know, like what what do you mean white people? >> Irish Americans, French Americans, uh do Spanish count, do Jews count? white is such a like a white and then you've done these terrible things to black and like what is black? Is that Haitian? Is that Jamaican? Is that So you look at it from like a fourth grade understanding of of these stories of what happened and you just overcorrect. So anyone who's not white must be good and anyone who's white should feel the guilt I felt when I learned those things. And you just overcorrect. So, you know, a black guy beats up your dad, you go, \"Well, you know, [laughter] he's, you know, I don't want to say, yeah, I don't want to say he did anything wrong. We don't really know the whole story cuz if I criticize that, then I'm racist.\" So, it's just like kind of this like si, like I think it's an oversimplification of what has happened historically. And when you forget history, then, right, forget if you never even learn history, then you don't really know. You're just kind of repeating the things that your friends say. And I think that's what happens. I think it's like a super overcorrection. I was in [ __ ] we were in Asia for months shooting this show and I remember one of the people on our show calling the people in Japan minorities. Like they're not minorities here. [laughter] >> We're in Japan, stupid. Like they're the majority. That's not how. But in our American kind of like fourth grade understanding of everything. We've we've just kind of viewed it as that. And it and that's what happens is it gets carried away. You start to say like, \"Oh, I don't agree with Islam.\" And they go, \"Oh my god, Jeff, that's pretty racist.\" You're like, \"That's not racist. I know what they believe according to the Quran and like what I've the studies that I've done or the little bit of homework that I've done.\" >> And I'm glad you made that little studies studies. The little bit of >> the things I know. Yeah. Is what I should have said. Mostly Sam Harris. >> Well, Sam is great on the subject of this life. >> Yeah. And I I I feel like um I don't know how to explain it. I should be able to disagree with anything I'd like and agree with anything I would like. I shouldn't factor my race or my gender or my age or any of those things. These are just our thoughts. We're we're we're humans. And so, like, I don't have to feel guilt when I say, \"Oh, I think that I'm treating a woman like that is is is wrong.\" And they go, \"Well, Jeff, oh my god, that's so uh that's so Islamophobic or whatever the hell the term is, or you know, that's so racist of you.\" And I go, \"No, these are just my thoughts. Despite whatever the culture, religion, or thing is.\" >> You know how at the beginning of every year, people say, \"This is a year things change, then by February, everything looks the same.

[snorts] >> I I think it's because in school we learn all we really learned about in history and all the things the only thing that we can really remember is Nazis. >> Yes. >> Do you know what I mean? So it's like Nazi Nazi Nazi Nazi. Someone's going to clip that. Nazi Nazi Nazi. Mhm. >> So then when we go through the world, we see good guys and we see Nazis. >> And that's how we look at everything. Oh, you Jeff goes, \"You know what? I don't really like the way that women don't have any really have any rights in many Muslim countries. I don't think that's cool.\" And they're like, \"Oh, good guy Nazi.\" Nazi, >> right? And they say, \"Oh, you don't understand their culture. You don't understand.\" Like, what do you I think that that would just be a basic thing. No matter what the culture is, no matter what the region is, probably don't hit her with sticks in the courtyard. And then they go, \"Oh my god, can you believe this guy doesn't even understand how our culture works?\" And I go, \"I don't I don't like it.\" >> Um, but I have a commitment or I've made a commitment to myself. Um, >> where I'm just going to say what I think about the thing and uh, and if I'm wrong, then I'll change my position on it when I feel like I'm wrong. But I feel like no matter what it is, I treat a woman as the same, which they don't like. They go, \"Hey, treat me like a woman.\" I go, \"No, I'm going to treat you the way I treat everyone else.\" Same with whatever religion it is or whatever culture it is, whatever race it is. I don't talk different because I'm around my black friends. I don't I don't uh I'm not more gentle with my opinions because a girl is in the room. I'm always just going to be the way it is. >> Yeah. And it's also as well like there are things that you that people say that sound controversial that kind of aren't. I remember I was on a date with a girl and she was like, you know, all cultures are equal. And I went, they're really not. And she was like, what do you mean? And I'm like, \"Well, would you prefer to live here or under Taliban rule in Afghanistan?\" And she was like, \"Yeah.\" And I'm like, \"So where's better?\" >> It's a hierarchy. Yeah. >> Yeah. And she was like, \"Ah, >> how did that date go, man?\" >> I mean, that was it. [laughter] >> I was also going to say like, \"What a fun hour you had right after [clears throat] that first sentence.\" >> Like just by being like being like, \"I disagree with all cultures are equal.\" And then you're like, \"Oh, that's that's going to be our next hour of talking.\" Yeah, for sure. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> But you won the argument. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. You won the battle and lost the war in that one. [laughter] >> Exactly. But that's the thing as well. It's like, and this is a thing that I get really I feel really sorry actually for young kids, which is politics is now everything and everywhere. Like we're the same like the same age. Like I don't remember being kids and like talking about, you know, George Bush's presidency. >> Yeah. You'd have to be a nerd to like a president or like a politician or a mayor or a governor or any of those things. It was very nerdy. >> Like do you remember I I don't know if you went to college but if you did it like if you did do you remember the kids who were into politics in college? >> No. >> Yeah. >> But I mean I didn't go to college [laughter] but I but you're making a good point. It's only everything has only become political in the last like 10 or eight years in my in my life. People go I don't remember you being so political comedically. I'm like everything's political. >> The I can't even be a comedian without being political because everything is political. The weather was not political when I was young. But you talk about how warm it is in spring or how it didn't launch into like them seeding the clouds. It didn't launch into global warming. It didn't launch, you know, into like oil companies and the farming. Like it was just you just talked about the weather. >> Whereas now there's nothing you can talk about that isn't political. It's like now we all are forced to be political. >> That's so interesting. I just saw a clip on your Instagram which is a great bit about how gun store owners can't take a joke basically >> and it's hilarious and I now that you said that I go well actually 10 years ago that would not have been a political joke >> cuz a Republican who gets humor would also go to a gun store and be like this guy's a bit uptight cuz cuz that's what a gun store owner is going to be. He's got to be serious. He's got to be disciplined. He's got to take the stuff that he does seriously and communicate that to his customers >> and everybody else can see that whether they are an R or a D. >> Yeah. >> But now I I process that bit as you go, oh jeeoff is pushing back against the it's so true. Literally everything you like >> I don't recall even sexual behavior being political and now it is. like like you were able to just like whatever you liked growing up where I grew up like you you had the gay neighbors and you had your straight parents and that was just your neighborhood whereas and and maybe this is just to unique to like Seattle area but now like you have to be progay like what does that mean progay like I have to root them on or like like I don't understand like what it means I don't even know what it means to be anti-gay like does that mean you like you you think it's gross because I do I do think it's gross but I also don't engage in it. Like that's I don't engage in anything that I don't like. I like even people who they're hooking up with is somehow a political statement. Like wearing like a a rain I support this community. It's like we they're just people. What do you mean you support them? Like I don't understand how even that is like a political march. It's very it's very strange. >> Oh man. We were just in San Francisco and I I walked into this coffee shop. By the way, it's a hack observation. Leftwing people do coffee much better than the right. the right the right the way they do coffee is aing disgrace anyway [clears throat] >> which is strange let's turn that around what's going on here >> and I sat down in this coffee shop in San Francisco and there were eight rainbow and pride flags >> and I'm like boys you're one >> and we get it >> who cares who you're >> Yeah >> no [clears throat] one gives it >> I'm not grossed out by it unless I had to like try to do it myself that would gross me out but but like I I go okay like I don't understand I don't really understand it >> yeah and it's kind of like everything now you have to be part of a of an identity cuz if you're not an identity then you're kind of on the outside which is why every white man is now neurode divergent >> because you need >> very convenient >> yeah you need something you can't just be a regular dude >> every female comic I know is bisexual but they're not they just say it to get the claps from the audience like I'm bisexual and the guys cuz that's a group they don't have to prove they're in it makes them look very open-minded, but they're they're all liars. >> Yeah. And it's like blackface is unacceptable, but gay face isn't, >> right? Yeah. Or drag. Drag is woman face. >> Yeah. >> That's That's a man admitting he's a man, pretending to be a woman, doing his best impression of a woman, wearing that. That's woman face. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. It makes no sense. >> It It doesn't make any sense. And it's just been, you know, it's almost like it's been mandated like you have to like this, you can't like this. You have to celebrate this. You have to be upset at this. >> And someone listening to this might say, \"Well, why does it matter? Who cares?\" Right? Like that maybe the Neil Dash, why do you care? Well, I'll tell you what. There's a big wave of young people sharing very racist reels, sharing very uh pro-Nazi, pro- um you know, very I don't know the right term for it. Very um alarming, I guess, for the uh reals. And why do you think they're doing that? Because it's almost punk rock now >> to do that. >> It is less about the hate and less about the racism and all the whatever. It's you've made it so exhausting. Society has made it so exhausting to be like this virtue signaling pro-LGBT pro like your your parents are these like soft people who wouldn't put hormones in their chicken but they'll put it in their fifth grade daughter, you know, [laughter] and so now you're going to witness this terrible rebellion that you're really going to regret. like they've they've they've fatigued everyone with all this [ __ ] and it's causing some I think some pretty alarming stuff on the internet of like what is becoming cool. >> Well, it's interesting, isn't it? Because that's definitely happening and it's it's it's not only is it happening kids being rebellious, you can see it bleeding into real politics. >> Yes. >> As well, >> Gypsy, whatever his name is with the clown face. You know this guy? >> No, >> he his gypsy crusader or something like that. >> Let's not give him a signal. Well, but you know this guy or Nick Fuentes or these things like you're wondering why it's taking off like why it's become because it's becoming naughty and edgy and political or not political naughty edgy and like um it's becoming punk rock. >> Yeah. It's like avang guard. It's like you're pushing you >> look how naughty I'm being which is very attractive to young people and like >> and it's very scary young men especially. >> Yeah, it is very scary. >> Um well it's it's an interesting dynamic. It was kind of predictable. I mean, it's one of the reasons that I was always so concerned about wokeness. As someone who was never never thought of myself as being on the right, I just was like, you guys are being [ __ ] Like, you do this, you're going to cause the exact same thing from the other side. And by the way, the other thing we talked about is like if you make it terrible to be a particular sex or a particular skin color and that's the worst thing you can be while you celebrate other people for their skin color and their sex, >> what do you think is going to happen? >> Yeah. >> What do you think all these guys you've been pointing your finger at for 10 years, what what they're just going to just sit there and take it? >> Yeah. No, they won't. Yeah, I know. Especially as you said with that young brain when you like know I probably didn't affect you and didn't affect me and didn't affect Francis cuz we're older. I've got my wife. She's like when she's like she sees a girl walking around or a guy walking around with the future's female teacher. She's this guy's [ __ ] dumb. Yeah. >> This is dumb. Like what what the is this? And but if you're a 15-year-old boy, >> you don't have anyone to tell you this is just a crazy phase in human history. [laughter] >> You're going this is the world. Yeah. And then your reaction to that is going to be what it's going to be. >> Yeah. The shirt should say the future is robot. That's what it [laughter] should say. >> That's accurate. >> Yeah. Because a good shirt would be the future is human. But we're not going that direction. I have always It's It's funny. I think that um the more I'm talking to you guys, the more I'm realizing smart people are good at just finding the double standard and then weighing the um the logic of it. You know, it's like it is so easy. It should be easy to understand. Hey, don't treat people wrong because of the color of their skin, but that would include all skin colors, >> right? >> Yes. >> Like, you'd think like that's a very, but they don't. They they they need a villain. They need they need a have to have a have not. They need an oppressor to have an oppressed. And so, they can't even see it as that. They've got to see it as like >> um let's unite white people, you know, [laughter] >> that's not united, you know, and so smart people can see that and then measure it and then try to like >> deal with it or whatever. I am always in an obsessive uh state of mind with like what am I allowed to judge? People who follow this show tend to think for themselves and anyone paying attention can see that the same carriers keep showing up in stories about data breaches, leaks, and surveillance scandals. If your provider keeps losing and selling your data, it's time to look at an alternative. That alternative is Cape, a premium mobile carrier built to protect your privacy rather than harvest it. Founded by experts in telecom, cyber security, and national security, Cape gives you the same level of service you would expect from AT&T or Verizon, but without the tracking and surveillance. Cape collects almost nothing at signup. No name, no social security number, no address. They cannot leak what they do not store. They also fix SIM swaps. So, you get a 24word phrase that is the only way to move your number. No one, not even Cape, can transfer it without that phrase. And here's the part most people never hear about. Most carriers still rely on the big network's cores and SIMs, which means the same tracking and vulnerabilities follow you. Cape's different. It owns and operates its own mobile core and provisions its own SIMs, giving it real control over your security. It's not the easy way to build a mobile carrier, but it is the only way to build one that actually protects you. Cape offers a $30 first month trial for new users. If this sounds like what you've been looking for and your phone is carrier unlocked and eSIM compatible, give it a try. And if you like it, you can use our code trigger 33 to get 33% off your first six months with Cape. Right? I think I judge everything cuz as a comedian, I'm very judgmental in my brain. But then I write I put it through reason. And then I go, \"Okay, here's where I was being wrong. Here's I was being immature. Here was I was maybe being a little afraid or here's why I was being\" and then I try to weigh it out. But like for example, like I don't need to be pro or anti-gay. Gay just is. and their opinion of my opinion of it is almost irrelevant because I'm not a gay guy. So, it doesn't matter. But I can still be respectful and I can still be nice and I can still have gay friend. I don't need to approve of any. I don't need to approve of tennis, you know? I don't my opinion of tennis is irrelevant. Similar to my opinion of being gay, but when can I start judging it? So, like if I like I'm smoking a cigar with my buddy and I'm in Seattle and a guy's walk. >> You really are on the right. [laughter] Yeah, I love a cigar. I don't have booze anymore, [snorts] so cigars are my thing. I'm smoking a cigar and this guy's walking his boyfriend >> on a leash. The boyfriend's got like a leather dog mask. And in my mind, I go, listen, I don't want to hurt those guys. I don't want anyone to be mean to those guys. I don't want anyone to shout anything to those guys. But can I go, what the are we doing? >> Yeah. >> When when can I nudge my buddy and go, look at these guys. You know what I'm saying? Like that's that's where I try to like figure out where cuz I think a hundred years ago if you saw that we what we would be allowed to like yell at those guys, right? >> They'd probably be arrested, you know. So I'm always wondering like where where when can I judge? >> That's right. >> Yeah. >> Well, I think you can judge that. >> Yeah, I judged it. >> Yeah. [laughter] >> Pretty hard. We judged it pretty hard. >> Yeah. You know, because to me when I see those guys, I go, \"Well, what you're doing that is provocative.\" >> Sure. >> I don't care how you want to frame it. You're doing that because you want a reaction. >> Yeah. >> So that I And so that you then have something to talk about. Otherwise, you wouldn't walk down the road dressed all in leather in a thong with your boyfriend on a leash wearing a dog mask. >> But also, it's got nothing to do with being gay anyway. Like if you if I saw a guy walking his wife on a leash, >> you'd also be like, \"What the is this?\" >> Great point. Yeah. And I also think it might even be more nefarious cuz they're thinking, \"Well, if this is normalized, then we're really making progress here. We're really going down the crazy socialist Marxist kind of what is what is kind of path.\" And if you can get away with that, well, we're doing pretty good in Seattle. If we can, you know, like we we we've made good progress here. I walked my boyfriend 10 blocks and everyone just waved. [laughter] Everyone let us just get away with whatever we want, right? >> Yeah. There's really no see something, say something anymore. >> You know, you say socialist and you know about the the dog walking boyfriend. I can't imagine Stalin was into that [ __ ] Do you know what I mean? >> Like it's so weird this kind of conflation of like >> extreme sexual practices and socialism. >> Yeah. >> Because in the old days like socialists were pretty socially conservative, >> right? You know what I mean? >> But they don't want that. So the the even by these new people's even by modern times definition of that they they do this [ __ ] with words. You guys are comedians where they go, \"Well, that's not real socialism, you know, oh that that that's not that was different or that wasn't real Marxism. The the good Marxism.\" And you're like, dude, they just that's all they do is they run with words all the time. And so the way they see it is like, well, no, this is breaking down the current system for our version of socialism. >> And I think what we need to do as people and and I remember just saying this when we used to have a lot of conversations about trans is just go, can we accept this is weird, >> right? >> This is just weird. You dressing up in leather, wearing a [ __ ] mask. >> Pretty funny. [laughter] >> Pretty funny. >> This is pretty funny. number one and taking your boyfriend for a walk dressed as a Pyrex dog or whatever it is. [clears throat] >> Can we just accept that's weird, >> right? I'm with you. They would go, \"No, why is it weird?\" And you go, \"Oh my god.\" You know, it's weird. Yeah. Yeah. I I find it fascinating, too, cuz like if someone would put like a a bird cage on their head and just wear a bird cage around on their head and then every time they go into a store be like, \"Can you believe the way everyone looked at me?\" It's like, \"Well, you're doing something different than what the group is.\" >> Yeah. >> That's all it is. So, like whenever people want to go off on these these white privilege or any of the things, it's like a lot of times the things you're summarizing as white privilege are just majority privilege. If I'm in Compton and I go to a McDonald's and I'm the only white guy within seven miles, they're probably going to look at me. They're just trying to figure out what I'm doing there. I got my gay sweater on. I'm a white guy. I'm clean. They're not staring at me because they're bigoted towards white people or they don't want me in their restaurant. They're just going, \"That's different than the most. What's he doing here? Why he what's he popping around about? What is he here to do taxes for us? Like, why is this white guy here?\" >> And so the so many things like that happen where it's it's just a majority and and then they react like, \"Can you believe it? They're staring at us because we're gay guys.\" And you're like, \"We're no they're not. You're just doing something different than the most.\" And that's what this trans whole thing is, is they like you're very clearly a male biologically and you're allowed to dress like a woman because you're a grown-up. We'll let you dress however you'd like, but let's not pretend that it's not unusual when you're doing something different than what the group is doing. >> And that's all it is. We look, we go, \"Okay, yeah, we're clocking it. You know, this is different than what else is going on.\" >> You know, we had a comedian on the show called Steve Hughes, a brilliant Aussie, so funny Steve. Brilliant comedian. And he made the point that, you know, he sees lots of people now like with a mohawk. And he's an older dude. He's in his mid50s. And he's like, \"Look, when I was growing up, if you had a mohawk, that meant you were saying you to society. I don't want to be accepted. I don't want a job in your bank. I'm a rebel. I'm on the outside. That's my choice. I'm punk.\" >> Yeah. >> Like now you get a mohawk. You wear a swastika like, you know, patch on your arm and you, you know, you walk around with your nipples pierced. Everyone can see it. You're like, \"Why can't I get a job at Goldman Sachs?\" >> Exactly. Yeah. No, you're nailing it. That's so true. And they're going, \"Can you believe the way everyone's looking at me?\" You go, \"Yeah.\" Yeah, that's kind of That was supposed to be the motivation. Yeah. >> Right. I love that. >> That's so funny. Do you think uh this is changing the culture? Do you think we've pro, you know, everyone talked about peak work. Do you think we've gone past that now? We're on the way down. Certainly in American comedy it feels like you know I mean you go to Austin you you watch some shows there like there's at least two retards and a [ __ ] and a whatever shocking >> you know >> it is >> well it kind of is cuz you almost go well maybe this is an overswing in the other direction. I was u this observation is actually hacked now because I said it years ago and now I've heard 20 people say my own sentiment back to me. But like I've I was kind of like one of the comedians early on being like let's just say what we think you know let's you don't have to be afraid of it. Like if it's funny like work it out and if it isn't funny you know you're just trying something but like we should be able to say whatever words and whatever thoughts we think about the subject. And then Austin really took that you know like like they were like yeah but then you go to like the open mic the guy's like these [ __ ] [ __ ] and I was like not like that you know we [clears throat] meant say whatever but not like that or not not not so recklessly. So there is like a kind of happy >> thing but I do think that um I think it's I think it's swinging back. I don't I don't think anything can go too absurd. So, it's like I think we have hit peak woke and it's going down, but I do think it might be swinging back a little bit like with the Charlie Kirk. Whenever there's like an issue, I feel like it kind of swings a little bit back and forth. Yeah. >> Yeah. Well, it's an interesting point, isn't it? Because like you say, I think what we always thought is like you find a happy medium between, >> you know, saying things that are controversial, but doing it in a in a way that's >> not actually hateful. >> Sure. And it can feel a little bit now like you talked about earlier online but also sometimes elsewhere that like the overswing in other directions also happen. >> It's just a it's kind of an extreme moment, isn't it? >> It is. And I also um >> it's fascinating to me that you don't do standup anymore. >> I find that very fascinating because I think that comedy we talked about a little bit before we started recording that comedy is such a great way to have people hear you. So, it's like, you know, when I'm on Fox News, there's no there's nobody turning on Gutfeld to be persuaded. There's [laughter] there's nobody, you know, when I when I did uh I campaigned for Trump in this last election and just it's comedy basically at these like things. Um, and I I actually would do a joke where I go, \"How many of you guys are undecided voters?\" And it would just be quiet. My work here's done, you know. Um, and I imagine that to be true even though I wasn't at a Camala Harris rally, but >> at there I would imagine also there was nobody right >> that was undecided. >> Whereas with standup, it's a room full of people and very often people who don't agree with anything, I think. >> Yeah. >> But comedy is a great mask to get into their hearts and brains and like say something, especially if it's funny. If it's funny, they go, why am I laughing at that? Did I find some truth in that or did it just hit my ears as shocking or why? They might have to ask themselves like why am I feeling that way about that guy's comedy or why am I laughing about that guy's comedy? Because sometimes when they get pissed off when they go home, they also have to explain that to themselves or who they came with. Like why did that bother me so much? And it's like you so you kind of inspire those conversations or those thoughts and standup is such a great cheat code into that. >> Yeah. Well, I would say humor is a great cheat code into that. So that's why when I'm writing satirical columns on my Substack or what or talking like I can still be funny. >> Sure. >> But uh I guess all that happened for me really was during the pandemic this took off >> and you also couldn't do standup >> right. >> So after like two years of that I just was like I'm really not that interested to you know going back to the comedy circuit while this has taken off and taking all of my time. That's really but humor I think your point is I I can't remember. I think it was Oscar Wild who said, \"If you want to tell the truth, people the truth, make them laugh, >> otherwise they'll kill you.\" >> I love that. >> And that's kind of like I think humor is a superpower. >> Well, Roomie used to start with jokes. >> So, he would tell a joke and his his goal was because it opens up a different type of listening. >> So, like, you know, with a song, we can probably have a conversation while someone's playing something beautiful and it's not going to affect the the quality of the of the environment. But with with uh poetry, you need to listen. And with a joke, you damn sure need to listen because if you even miss one word, you're not gonna get the joke. And so he would always start with a joke, which also is a great icebreaker and then drop some wisdom on you. And so I think that like comedy or jokes is are so important, but I love it to be able to get in front of people who would otherwise just write me off as a straight white conservative guy. >> And uh I don't I don't know why I asked you that, but I was just >> No, no, no. It's an interesting conversation. I don't know if you've seen any speeches I've done, but whenever I do a speech, I totally take that on board because the way I think about it is humor is basically every time you do a joke that makes people laugh, if you're talking, you're buying 10 seconds of their attention. >> They're like, \"Oh, maybe I'll listen to the next 10 seconds.\" And then there's another punch line. Oh, maybe I'll listen for 15. And by the time you get to the end of a 10-minute speech, you can actually say a minute's worth of actual opinion. >> Sure. >> And they'll go, \"Oh, oh, that's interesting.\" >> Yeah. Well, and also when you're writing a joke, uh, as opposed I've never written a column or anything or an article, but, uh, with when I'm ranting on my podcast, which I guess would be comparable to like a rant or, you know, an article, it's all my opinions. And so, I find myself not trying to be as reasonable. Whereas with a joke, I'll often go like, well, what's the other side of this? And I'll try to find a thing, you know? >> And so, I'm always doing that with my jokes is like >> I don't think I'm being harsh on on uh on gay people. I'm just being honest and I'm going to get down to the bottom of this and then I'll always like uh I'm trying to think of a good example of that in my act. Well, I guess when I talk about women like like it's all for women like everything we do is for women and I tell them that but like in exchange they should be pretty happy about that. >> Why are you being so hard on us and it's also all for you. >> So it's like I'll give but I also I expect like a little bit of like take on it, you know? So I try to do that and then I find that very fun in standup to do. And is the you mentioned that everything's political now. You do a lot of material about men and women dating which is really funny. >> Thanks. >> Do you do you think that's become political as well or is that it has? >> Yeah, I think for sure. >> Really? >> Yeah. because women um have considered themselves to be like some sort of group you know just all women somehow are on the same team which I've never experienced [laughter] but for somehow in their brain they they will go women aren't like that you know they're very uh defensive about their tribe of being women and so you know you can't even say a thing sometimes like I could be like I could say something as simple as women hate video games >> and that triggers them like not all women and you're like geez why why would feel so passionate about this. Do you know any that play video games? There's like one for every 9 million guys that does. But even that somehow is some sort of statement to them. And I think it's this neverending diet they've been fed of rights and privileges and patriarchy and all all these things have have I don't know if it's the if it's the universities or if it's just modern times or what it is, but they've been fed all this stuff and they're they're falling in line with it. What's interesting is there actually well obviously but there is uh quite a lot of variability within how women think about things even politically like married women with kids do not vote the same way as unmarried young women in big cities. Correct. Like those are two very different groups of people that beyond their vaginas really don't have that much in common. >> Yeah. No 100%. >> You know and but but there is that sort of group tribal mentality with it nonetheless >> which makes no sense. I mean, I never thought I would see millions of women in the street passionate about killing their offspring. It's almost like it's gotten to the point where they're suggesting that abortion is good. A while back, I pushed myself in training because I'm a bit of a legend, but ended up with a back strain that took far longer to recover from than it ever used to. Nothing dramatic, just one of those moments where you realize your body isn't snapping back the way it once did. And as you get older, those moments start adding up. Turns out there's a real reason for that. Your stem cells are the repair system your body relies on. They're the internal maintenance crew that keeps you healing, recovering, and functioning. But that system slows with age. Fewer cells, weaker signals, slower bounceback. That's exactly why Qualia built their stem cell formula. It uses wellressearched ingredients like seab buckthornne and royal jelly to support your repair system so your body can keep doing what it's meant to do. And it isn't something you take every day. Just 4 days a month to help maintain your regenerative capacity over time. So if you've ever felt like your body just doesn't bounce back like it used to. Whether it's after a tough workout, getting sick, or the wear and tear of life, Qualia Stem Cell is for you. Qualia stem cell was designed to support your body's natural repair systems, helping you heal, recover, and keep going strong. And right now, you can try it for up to 50% off at qualia.com/trig.

Big thanks to Qualia for sponsoring this episode. [snorts] >> Like we should able we should be able to come to the agreement that abortion is not a great day. Whether you believe you should be able to get one or not get one, you can agree that's not a great morning. No one's excited to go, hey, let's get coffee today and then go get an abortion where the convers like we should at least be able to fundamentally agree that's a bad morning, right? >> Yeah. and and we can't People literally are going, \"No, I think this is this is my like they almost talk about it in a different way than the reality of it is.\" >> Well, you said it just now, didn't you? It's about rights. Rights have become this like sacred thing. >> So, we no longer think about, well, what is it a right to do? Like, your right to take a dump. I respect it, but I'm not going to celebrate the act. >> Absolutely. >> Right. >> Yeah. Thank you. [laughter] >> Whatever it is, like do you see what I'm saying? Like we've fetishized this idea of rights so much now that I think that's where it's come from. So they're not even thinking about what it is that they are promoting. And also it's kind of sticking it to the man as well. I think >> I agree 100%. I it's funny you said that because I think about it with maybe this is another thing we were talking about earlier about how how we got here is that the overcorrection or or the the idea of like there's nothing good about being a homeless man but we feel so much sadness that someone would be in that position that we've now championed them almost as an underdog. Now we're almost like rooting for them because they're a homeless person and you're like, well, you know, you shouldn't celebrate it like you were just saying. Same with being like a single mom. We treat single moms very good because it's hard to be a single mom and it's an unfortunate position to find yourself in and it's expensive and difficult and timeconuming, but it shouldn't be the goal. You shouldn't go good for you, you're a single mom. Like that shouldn't be the goal. We're just saying if you find yourself in that position, we feel a certain way towards you and we'll give you, you know, you deserve your credit for being in that position. >> And so like I think that all gets lost, >> right? It's like, you know, if you get cancer, we feel bad for you, but we don't go >> right. Yeah. Exactly. >> Let's celebrate this cuz it's not good, right? Look, I'm not comparing single moms to cancer. I think that might be going a bit far, but you know what I mean. It's like it is not a good outcome. And statistically, the evidence is very clear on that. What happens to kids particularly who grow up now? There are some amazing single moms. Yeah. >> But would if you speak to them would they have chosen to be in that position in an ideal environment? >> No. >> Most of them not. >> Yeah. And also Yeah. Like it's hard to explain that to people the way I'm at least thinking about it. It's hard to articulate it is that like there's nothing wrong with being a single mom, but that you you should even know that that's not the goal. and it is your right to terminate a pregnancy, but you should know that that's not a good thing. Like that's not the position you should want to be in to have to make that decision. So, it's it's just it's all tricky. >> You know, it's when I was teaching, I never met a kid who was like, you know what, I'm glad I don't have a dad, >> right? >> Yeah. No, that's not a sentence anyone should say. Yeah. >> Yeah. You know, >> but they don't say. >> Yeah. >> They don't say it. >> Yeah. They don't say that. That's the point. And I just think it's like we want all this stuff. We just don't want any responsibility with it. We want to eat the fries without getting fat. >> Yep. >> You know, we want to eat we want >> That does sound pretty good. >> Yeah. It sounds amazing. >> We want freedom, but we don't want war. >> Yeah. >> We want to be safe, but we don't want guns. Yeah. Like 100%. >> Yeah. And and that's kind of how we now live where it's just like, you know, I'm anti-war. And you go like everyone's anti well there's a few people are not anti-war but but you're like but dude that every most people are anti-war but the reality is if you want peace there are times where you're going to have to go to war unfortunately >> you can't be anti-war if there's Adolf Hitler going we go you know you there comes a point where you got to fight >> and I don't think people really understand that I think we've just got so used to being comfortable to being safe that this idea that you might have to protect it or do something unpleasant or even acknowledge that if you do something there's going to be a trade-off to it. We can't live in that world anymore. >> I know. I wish everyone could understand that and hear that. It's like what's so good about being safe? Like like like in what in your life has ever been gained by by a safe space or by not having like a challenge or not like working hard or not like everything that is good had that balance of being like difficult or being like the worst thing I ever went through or like even having a baby like a pregnancy is uncomfortable and it's you feel gross and it takes 9 months which is a long time and it it's it's it's painful and Even the birthing process is like the most painful thing in the world. But you get a baby at the end. That's the kind of the point is that like everything has difficulties to it. I don't know what these young people are very obsessed with like being safe and everyone's feelings and everyone accommodated. It's like yeah, it's not really how it works. And you go shouldn't want it. You shouldn't want that. >> But it's kind of like lying in bed all day and you go, I'm comfortable. And you go, well, yeah, you are comfortable, but a you're not going to do anything and b you're going to get fat and c your muscles are going to rot away. >> Yeah. And it's not that great after a few hours. Yeah. So, and I think that the more you become accepting of discomfort and go, you know what, life is about being uncomfortable and if you actually want to achieve anything, most of the time it's not going to be comfortable. You see a hot girl in a coffee shop, you're like, oh, I maybe I'll go and talk to her. That's going to be pretty uncomfortable. >> But, you know, especially for her. >> Yeah. Exactly. >> But that nervousness is something you overcome. >> And that's why it's rewarding. Like when I see like this is a strange thing, but like when I see like a beautiful woman, I'm like I have no feeling about it. I don't even want to do anything about it. Like I like I go I don't feel nothing, you know? Like you need that nervousness. You need that like should I I might get rejected. Like that that's the balance of all of it. >> Yeah. And you know what's worse is walking away because it feels good in the moment but a couple of hours later you're like >> Yeah. >> She was she looks great. She was there riding in her junk. >> That was my chance. >> That was my chance. Maybe that was that was the one, >> right? >> Yeah. But you never know because you walked away. >> And that's the same with everything in life. Like you've got this great new joke. >> Maybe you try it, but maybe you'll lose the room. >> Yeah. >> Maybe you'll be like, \"Hey, you know, maybe your Nazi Muslim stuff isn't the thing for you. Look for the vegan poetry cafe in Brooklyn didn't like it.\" [laughter] >> Yeah. >> But you'll never know. >> Speaking of women, changing subjects slightly. You live in LA. >> Yes, sir. Lots of beautiful women, but they all look about half their actual age nowadays. Is this just a me thing or is this real? Like everyone seems to have got some kind of injection of some kind. The foreheads >> I don't know if it's the injections, but I think we're aging better as people. >> Oh, you think it's just that? >> Yeah. I mean, maybe. I'm I don't know. Do you guys find that to be true? >> Oh, man. Have you ever seen Oh, this is probably the wrong reference to you, but soccer players in the 1970s. They're like 26. >> Yeah, but they look old as hell. Yeah. >> Yeah. They look in their 50s. my dad. I found a photo of my dad. Um he in the photo we clocked that he was like 34 years old >> and he looked way older than me now and I'm 42 and I was just like what? And I was like well he had three kids by that age and he had like my mom to deal with and he was stressed out of his mind working all the time. >> But I think >> I was just actually having this conversation with someone last night is that like >> I think vanity's gone a long ways but in a but for in good in a good way. >> Like even you guys are my age. You look young to me. Like I'm I'm sure if we had a college, you know, we'd all be considered old guys to them. >> Yeah. >> But we definitely look better than the men that were our age like a hundred years ago. >> Oh, dude. >> Yeah. >> Like it's insane. Like we all have a full head of hair. We we you know, we we don't look I don't know how to explain it, but I think I think it's vanity is what I think it is. We've we've spent all of our all the generations have spent so much time on moisturizer creams and healthy food and guiltiness about things. So I don't know what I I chalk it up to vanity but >> right well and also we do live in a society that is more youth conscious than I think it ever was. I think if you were a politician in the mid40s, 30s of of the last century, having gravitas and status and kind of that comes with age, the wise old head would that would have been supervalued. Yeah. Whereas, >> you know, I mean, Biden and Trump are kind of an exception to what I'm about to say. But but but mostly we do think, you know, we need change. We need young blood. We need someone who's fresh. You know, I remember when Obama first came in. Oh my god, he was so young and so cool, >> charming, and >> he was the first like superstar president, >> right? Like I was the first president I ever saw, first politician I ever saw on ESPN like explaining his NCAA bracket and I was like, \"This feels strange.\" [laughter] Like I cuz I like to picture the president just at a desk with stacks of paper and he's pulling out his hair and he's trying like that's what I picture politicians are always doing. Yeah. And then I saw that and I was like, I guess he has time to like spin a basketball on his finger and like talk to MTV. Like I remember like that was like the first thing. Yeah. >> Yeah. He was he also had the very best answer to the question no one asks politicians anymore in this country. But it was like the defining question is have you ever smoked marijuana? >> Oh yeah. >> And and the answer was you know all the Republicans would be like yeah I did but I didn't inhale. >> Right. >> Clinton's answer. Yeah. >> Well and Clinton basically all of them. And then they went to Obama. They went, \"Did you inhale?\" And he went, \"Yeah, that was the point.\" >> That's great. >> So funny. You know, >> which I think we're witnessing with Trump. >> Yeah. >> Trump, what everyone didn't like about Trump or what everyone criticized about Trump was like like how wild he was with his language and sentences and opinions and stuff, but they claimed they hate that. Now they're all doing it. Look at AOCC's Twitter. Look at like look at the way Elizabeth Warren now talks when she's talking to the press. like they all hate him for it. But they're doing it. They're doing the exact same thing. So like um if they would have stuck to their guns and just like been like, \"No, we're going to keep this political kind of thing,\" I would give them the I would allow them to hate Donald Trump. But it seems like they're very inspired by his antics and the way he talks. >> You know what's so smart about Trump is the fact that he's funny. And because he's funny, he makes a joke and no one cares what happens afterwards because we live in the social media age. He's got the clip and the so and the people and MSNBC, they've got the clip. They can put it on their Twitter. It will go viral. So I'll give you an example. He was asked about I think it was on Air Force One and the journalist went to him, what do you think about Zoran Mammi? People say that he's the Trump of the left and he went you know I'm much better looking than Zoran. And then they all laugh. >> That's funny. >> And then that's all the people remember. Boom. And it went viral. >> Yeah. >> It's so powerful and it's so smart. >> It's a great strategy for sure. Yeah. It's It's almost like the art of war. Like like he knows exactly how to wiggle these things. I don't know if I like that Trump's funny. He's inarguably funny. >> No. Yeah. Hilarious. >> I don't know if I want him to be. I like him when he's just saying things he thinks. And I also like him that he's funny, but I don't know if it's good. I don't know if it's a good thing because it just drives all the people that don't like him insane and they act insane. Like they they can't process it. And so for me, it's like I don't know if I need my president to be funny. Like like I I I don't want my doctor to be funny, you know? Like I want my comedians to be funny. I don't mind if actors are funny or these other people, but like I don't know if if it's good for us or not because when Trump says a funny thing like that, my crazy neighbor just loses his mind. >> Do you hear what he said? He said, \"Oh, he's talking about he's better looking like and so [laughter] I don't know if it's it's very productive.\" >> Yeah. It's it sort of pandas to your base, but it's polarizing. I guess it's polarizing. It's polarizing. I'm in a I'm in a constant um mindset of like how can we bridge the gap, >> right? >> I don't agree with a ton of the left's policies, but I still see them as Americans. I still see them as like I like to think of us as fellow men, you know, like I would like to get along with all the people. I would I would hope someone would say the person I wanted to win didn't, but I hope that they have what's best in mind for America. Like that's what I like to think. Um, and that's my goal at least. >> That's so interesting. I was at a I was in Australia. I was doing small tour of Australia a couple years back I think. And I was at a dinner where there was a bunch of politicians left and right. And one of them the the guy who was hosting a good friend of mine stood up and he went, \"You know, I I've always known that the other party will get elected at some point and I want them to be the best possible government for Australia.\" >> And I was like, \"Oh my god, I haven't I haven't heard this for like 20 years.\" >> Yeah. I think that's good. >> Of course. >> Yeah. Well, because like Yeah. I mean, it's it's simple like you like in like any sport, you might not like your captain, but like at least he's we're all trying to win, you know? We're all trying to we should have the same goal, >> right? >> Like nobody wants to see >> like I don't like when people post like liberal tears or like any of those kind of things. And I think that's kind of what Trump channels. Yeah. >> And I am a Trump guy. I like Donald Trump. I just think, you know, if I'm going to comment on his imperfections, I I don't think the trolling is a good idea, even though it is funny. >> I like it. The bad part of me likes it. >> Well, that's part of a very good point because I I think like as an just an outside observer, you hear people talking less and less about the fact that we're all American and much more about the other side. >> Yeah. >> And at the end of the day, this is a country of people who have things in common. Yeah. >> Like leftwing Americans and right-wing Americans are more similar than people in other countries >> with similar political views to that particular thing. Do you know what I mean? Like even leftwing Americans are still like incredibly aspirational. We were talking about this before we started like your your time on in Britain on the aisle of aisle of man or aisle of white. Right. Like the same American dream thing is not going on in the aisle of white. >> Yeah. Not at all. No. They It was very I I was I've never felt more American than when I was in the aisle of white. We would shoot like a scene and like um we were all aliens. It's kind of like uh the the project that's that we were shooting was the idea of like it's it's kind of like Star Wars if it was a comedy. So like modern times is like now there's pe creatures from all these planets that are all like on all the planets kind of diversifying and they'd be like all right you're gonna come into this bar and they're like uh just you know do something just just wing it for this take like let's you're a comedian just do something funny. So I'm going into this bar with all these aliens and stuff and I I'm an alien also and I figure that he's drunk and they've booked me to be this like louder you know this loud uh you know Americanish kind of alien. So I come in, I just wing it and I was like, \"Yeah, there's so much [ __ ] here.\" And I just watched like everyone be like, \"The is this guy doing?\" And I was like, \"That'd be like a real normal thing for like an American bro to say, you know?\" And I watched all the directors lay on their headset like, \"Can you believe what he just said?\" Like on the thing. I I felt like at least the little experience I had of the week in the aisle of white, I was like, \"I was just such a big loud ass, you know.\" But you also you did ask some British people what their dreams were which I that's a sketch in itself man. >> Oh my god. Yeah. They they didn't know what to do with that question. [laughter] I was like so like what do you guys and they were just literally like we have a family and we live here. This is this is kind of the thing. And I was like all right sorry to ask you know. >> Yeah. It's but the point that you were making about the liberal tears is so profound because if you truly love your country you want a good strong left-wing opposition. because they're going to hold the right to account >> 100%. >> You want the Democrats, you want a kind of Obamaike figure who the moment Trump steps you takes a misstep, he is on him and he's going, \"Hey, >> that's wrong. What you're doing here is not called for A, B, C, D, and E reasons. Sort this out.\" >> Right? >> Because if you don't have that, then the people because it's human nature, they're going to be like, \"Hey, I got away with this. I can get away with this. I can get away with that.\" >> Yeah. I think also too um I know this is like a kind of overlapping grand scheme kind of idea but well I think one of the biggest problems that we're having in our country is that people are treating their politics like religion >> and so all these people they've all abandoned religion like it's so trendy to say I'm not religious and I hate Christians or blah blah blah unless the religion is outside of America then it's beautiful because it's a different race you know but they hate any kind of domestic religion they hate any sort of like religious behavior behavior. They scoff at church. They publicly criticize Christianity. Yet they act out their politics as religious zealots that like the the behavior they claim they hate, they do for their politics. So they'll say, \"Oh, I would I I don't even talk to my parents anymore. I can't believe they think like that.\" Or like anyone that would vote for him is I couldn't do it. I would never date someone that like they're they're they're acting it out. And I think that's the biggest problem is you should be interacting with with the other side. Like you should be having you should have friends that have all different thoughts and ideas. And in my opinion, that's the biggest problem with what we're going through. >> It's completely true. I remember talking to this comedian and he said to me, you know what? I don't have any friends that I disagree with. And I'm like, well then you're a child. >> That's a problem. Yeah. >> You're a child. Because what that means is you can't bear one moment of discomfort of somebody going, \"Hang on. You know, this thing you said is actually not true, >> right? And how not fun must that be? >> Yeah. >> Yeah. >> That must be terrible to just No one disagrees with you at all ever. >> Like that's insane that it like like a day in that life would be pretty boring. >> Well, man, it's been great having you on. Really enjoy this. Your stuff is awesome. I hope people check you out. I'm sure they will. Uh we're going to go to Substack and ask you questions from our audience. >> In a second, but before we do, last question is the same. What's the one thing we're not talking about as a society that we really should be? >> One thing we're not talking about that we should be talking about as a society that we should be maybe I mean kind of like overlapping what we were just talking about is just like getting along like like what do you really want? Like what's the goal? You know, like why like why do you want to view people as other? I think we've live in such a debate culture that nobody's having conversations where they can just go, \"Oh, that's an interesting perspective.\" Or, \"Oh, I agree with that. Now let's chew on that.\" They want to win. There's there's the the goal is to win the argument, not not not come to a nice understanding. They're trying to defeat each other. And I think that we should be talking about uh you know, we should be we should be trying to get along is what I think. >> All right. Head on over to triggerpod.co.uk where we ask Jeff your questions. [music] >> I think it's okay to tell any joke no matter what the setup subject or how offensive it is if it's funny. The risk of falling out of a friend or or an audience over it is on the teller. Do you agree? [music]"

    "transcript": "Congratulations. The multipolar world you ordered is here, [music] and now we all get to suffer the consequences. For several years now, there's been much talk about the end of the post-war order and the coming of a multipolar world. The desiraability of this wonderful new arrangement has been pushed by three groups. Naive woke leftists, similarly naive isolationists, and of course, and above all, our enemies. Each had their reasons. Western progressives view the world through a simple warp but powerful lens. Their approach to global politics is exactly the same as their view of domestic politics and is based on the appealing but misguided idea that success is always and everywhere the product of unearned illotten privilege. Their antipathy towards the west, white people, men, Jews and the rich stems from this basic formula. Whoever is doing well must be doing so at the expense of others. To them, any imbalance in wealth, income, influence, and so forth is necessarily bad and to be corrected. At the domestic level, the culmination of this worldview is their demand for social justice, a forced redistribution of wealth, influence, and opportunity from the oppressors to the oppressed. You don't need to be a Robin D'Angelo acolyte to see how this Marxist dynamic extends to global affairs. Social justice at home becomes global justice abroad. If the world is unequal, which it is, then that must be corrected. Their extraordinary ignorance of the world beyond the borders of the safe, peaceful, and civilized countries they live in is extremely helpful in this regard because it prevents them from seeing that peace, stability, and prosperity are the products of culture, science, and innovation. Instead, they argue that the West's recent dominance is a product of colonialism, racism, and imperialism. They hate the west for being successful and want a multipolar world as both a punishment and a corrective. The isolationists on the other hand are primarily an American phenomenon, albeit one which has spread to other parts of the west along with every other aspect of American culture. I have some sympathy for their instincts, even though they are in my view as misguided as the woke left about the way the world actually works. Having traveled extensively around America, I well understand the feeling of a man living a comfortable life in rural Ohio being asked to care about events happening halfway around the world. When I sit on the porch of my Airbnb somewhere in the middle of America, I find it much harder to care about those events, too. For this reason, among others, isolationism has always existed in American history and was particularly powerful in the 1930s. Franklin Delanor Roosevelt, the president who orchestrated America's support for Britain during World War II and his country's eventual full involvement in that conflict, had to tread extremely carefully around this faction until Pearl Harbor. The outcome of that war, an overwhelming moral and military victory over indisputable evil, kept isolationists quiet for some time. But the horrors of Vietnam, compounded by the trillion dollar disasters of Afghanistan and Iraq, have understandably produced a powerful backlash against interventionism. America can't be the world's policeman when the cry. Unfortunately, simple slogans are rarely true and inevitably leave out much needed context. America accounts for 5% of the world's population, but 25% of its GDP. Much of this is due to geography, natural resource wealth, and the ingenuity and drive of her people. But much of it also stems from the fact that America is the world's most powerful country. An advantage she uses with great skill to get the best deals, secure access to resources, and shape global affairs in a way that benefits her and her allies. To pretend that Americans can continue to enjoy unprecedented prosperity, security, and peace as their country completely withdraws from global affairs is to misunderstand the way the world works. There's a strange irony here. The two groups that have most celebrated the coming multipolar world are now also the ones complaining the most about its consequences. And that is because despite their good intentions, woke leftists and neoisolationists have served as useful idiots to the people who are actually driving the multipolarity narrative. Hostile foreign powers that feel it is their moment to end American hegemony. China's economic growth and Russia's recovery from the collapse of the USSR occurred at precisely the same time as the collapse of the West's moral, economic, and military authority. The shifting balance of power naturally produced a hunger for a different arrangement. Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the terrorist attack of October 7th, and China's increasingly open coveting of Taiwan are all signs of a deeper geopolitical realignment. For the moment, the demographic and economic tide has swung powerfully against the West. Our enemies are emboldened by their growing strength, encouraged by our weakness, and no longer constrained by international law, which was only ever worth the paper it was written on, while the US was willing to act as the world's policeman. Europe and Britain especially are particularly responsible for the sorry state of affairs. We've degraded our militaries to the point where despite our technological and scientific superiority, the courage of our soldiers, sailors, and airmen, and the rich military tradition Britain in particular can be so proud of, we are not a useful ally to the United States anymore. The condition of armed forces is matched only by the degradation of our culture and the economic suicide we've committed over the last two decades. Unprecedented, unwanted, and unassimilable levels of mass immigration have brought in millions of people who would never fight for our country, while at the same time creating an environment in which native young people understandably have little desire to fight for politicians who've betrayed the future they were owed. Nowhere is this more true than the economy. Unaffordable welfare spending has been paired with the purposeful destruction of our manufacturing and industrial base. Our deliluded attempt to save the planet has rightly been called net zero because it has produced zero growth for two decades. Britain's GDP per capita is lower today than it was 20 years ago. Germany, meanwhile, famously shut down its nuclear power plants for ideological reasons, making itself entirely reliant on Russian energy. The result, when Putin invaded Ukraine, Germany's initial response was to send a few helmets. Europe has been living in a dream world, and the rude awakening is here. So where does that leave us? What will this beautiful multipolar world look like? The easiest way to understand the geopolitics of the next decade is to look at Mexico. For two decades now, that country has been a war zone with dozens of drug cartels fighting for territory, influence, and resources. What happens when one is weakened or decapitated? The same thing that always happens when there's a power vacuum, a power struggle. As I tried to explain to Janis Varafakis in this debate, a multipolar world is by definition a more unstable, violent world. This is why it's highly regrettable that we've arrived here. It's also why President Trump is doing the only thing he can under the circumstances, the best thing he can for his cartel.

The world is changing fast and it's not enough to just know what the news is. You have to know how it's being reported because the truth often depends on where you're standing. That's why I use ground news. It's the only website and app that gathers and compares news from over 50,000 sources around the world. It doesn't just show you the headlines. It also breaks down the political bias and who owns the media outlet you're reading or watching. When you know where the money is coming from, you start to understand how power and influence shape the stories we see. Their blind spot feed is my favorite feature. It shows you which stories are being ignored by either the left or the right, so you can actually spot media bias as it's happening and stay ahead of the narrative. They surface around 20 of these a day, and some of them are pretty eyeopening. This story on the UK developing a predictive tool to determine if someone will become a killer barely showed up in left-leaning outlets. It's a major story when you think about how far governments might go with AI and surveillance. And on the other side, this story about how more than 60% of CEOs expect a recession in the next 6 months currently has no coverage in right-leaning media at all. That's a pretty big blind spot when you're trying to understand where the economy might be headed. If you're someone who values nuance over noise, ground news is essential. It's no wonder they have over 10,000 five-star reviews. Right now, trigonometry viewers can subscribe and get 40% off their Vantage plan. That's the same one I use.

    "transcript": "I've been [music] a target of being cancelled so many times that I stopped caring. >> Did you get sued? I can sue you if you do that to me. >> I don't know if I would do that again. >> So, I got to meet President Reagan, which was [music] a big deal. Ate his dinner when he left the table. Then I got fired from that for uh an incident [music] involving little people, the IKEA sex party. And so the IKEA finally sued. So that was like not good. guy lighting his guitar on fire [music] I thought was gonna turn on turn on all the sprinklers and just get me fired. If all the sprinklers had gone on, it would have destroyed [music] the net. It would have like the whole network would go down. >> Greg, are you hopeful for America? >> Yes, I am. [music] I don't know why. [laughter] >> Greg Gutfield, welcome to trigonometry. >> Thanks for having me here. Quite rustic in here. A lot of books. >> There are a lot of books. It's great to have you on, man. Yeah, I've been meaning to do this for a long time. >> Uh, tell us your story cuz you've had you've got a great show on Fox. People love it, but you've got a fascinating life story as well. >> Yeah, it's it's not an overnight sensation. It was it it was a lot of uh twists and turns. I started in publishing. Uh, I think my first my first publishing job where I did no writing or publishing was at the American Spectator, small uh conservative political rag out of Arlington. I was a staff assistant. got to meet President Reagan, which was a big deal. Ate his dinner when he left the table. Uh that was like that was like the made the entire $12,000 a year job worth it was he was at my boss's house uh for cuz cuz Reagan would do like two dinners a year and he came to my boss's house, Bob Tur, and I was the his assistant. So I was cleaning the place up and all this [ __ ] and in return I could stay there. And uh when um they were finishing, it was like 12 people. When they finished eating, I saw that Reagan hadn't uh finished his uh chicken. So I moved over around the table and when they I just scooped the chicken up and I shoved it down my throat. >> Like a cat. >> Like a cat. It just It didn't matter. Bones, you name it, everything. Because I was just I I don't know if Did we have DNA back then? I had his DNA in me. That's all that mattered. That was like 87 88. >> So he's still president. >> Yeah. >> So it was like was he he was the election was 88. So yeah, he was president in 88. >> Yeah. I was going to make a joke. So you were like Monica Lewinsky basically. >> Yes. [laughter] >> I was the first Lewinsky. >> Somewhat unflattering comparison. >> Yes. I wasn't wearing a blue shirt though. That's [laughter] the difference. But yes, I was there. Then um I went back home, moved back home with my mom because I wanted to be a writer and so I started writing uh weird satirical pieces and I got one into the San Francisco Chronicle and that was like my first published piece. I was very excited but I wasn't making any money. So, I took a job in Allentown, Pennsylvania as an editor for Prevention Magazine, which was a health magazine, and it was like basically the world's largest health magazine for like it was the audience was like middle-aged to older women with cats. And so, I I uh got totally into fitness journalism and uh I parlayed that into a gig at Men's Health uh which was the AB the we invented abs. You did not know what abs were until Men's Health came aboard because remember before Men's Health, it was all biceps, >> but then abs were the new biceps. And I'd like to think I started it. I wrote all How old are you guys? >> 43, 42. >> So it was You were in your 20s in the 90s, >> so did you ever buy Men's Health? >> I did buy Men's Health. >> Yeah. So all those ab cover lines, I wrote those like >> four steps to flat abs. That was me. [laughter] But it was great cuz I understood the whole thing about magazines that I used in TV was packaging. >> And I think that that is something that um was missing in like it's like you it's the whole package. >> It's how it looks. It's what are the five things and like with men's health it was easy. It was like sex, stress, muscle, fitness, nutrition. And it's like if you just stuck to those cover lines, you would have a hit magazine. And I I started to had a little chart where I'd throw a dart and I'd have like the all the little things in a guy's life and then the setups like five steps to how to get rid of the best way to the worst way to and then I would just throw a dart and you boom and I'd get a story. >> That is so interesting because it's almost like human nature is so consistent over time. Like you look at YouTube now and you go, \"Well, our friends, you know, Steven Bartlett or Chris Williamson, I mean, they're doing that.\" >> Yeah. No, it's it's a it's a big deal. Actually, I find that so refreshing that there there are and and I I guess it's refreshing because it's also kind of on our side, >> you know what I mean? Cuz when you look at the other side, I'm talking like politically or socially, they don't look like they care about their fitness. I think it's basic. Remember when they started saying fitness was like white supremacist far right? It was because we were just better looking. [laughter] >> I don't know about that. Maybe on the male side. On the female side, this is kind of if I were a single man now, I'd have to say the work girls are kind of hot. >> I You know what? >> More conservatives. I don't I don't mind saying that either, but the woke girls. >> Yeah. Okay. Hey, you know what's you know what's interesting about that is that you're probably I'd say they're they're probably the same >> but only one side makes beauty uh uh a product of patriarchy and so they encourage like if if if you take a reasonably attractive girl and put her in the woke machine in three years you won't recognize her >> because you know it's like I don't need to I don't need to get dressed why would I why would I do my hair if it's is to please a guy. So, you get that kind of like weird transformation. I don't know if you remember those things on X where they show a girl before and then after and she when she's woke >> and uh and I think you're seeing now the rebound with like all the like TPUSA. I used to go to those things. Have you been to a TPUA? It's like everybody there is like they walked out of uh uh >> Ralph Lauren. >> Yeah, thank you. I was going to say Teen Vogue, but that would have been a terrible example. [laughter] RIP. But uh where was I? Oh, and then I Yes, I was at Men's Health. I was there. Uh got fired. And then >> How did you get fired? >> Um >> if it's a boring story, skip it. But usually getting fired is kind of funny. >> There's a number of things. What happened after I got fired was funny, but uh I had done a story in it was like 2000 called the best colleges for men. This is so far ahead of its time. It wasn't >> I remember that. When was that? >> It was probably 2000. >> Yes. cuz I went to college that year and my friends ended up like, \"Dude, you have to read this.\" >> It was all about speech. It was all about all the all the weird what we would call woke >> that was happening on campuses. But I I can't remember who wrote it. It might have been Harry Stein or Dennis Bole, some older writer. >> And it got so much grief within the company because the company wrote was very liberal. And uh there was a box there, a sidebar on the worst colleges and I think the number one worst college happened to be the one that the CEO went to. So that was it. >> So but then what happened was I got fired. I don't know how this I I you know an editor has a editorial letter that they put in the front of the magazine. So within the week after I got fired, I I rewrote it and I sent it and replaced the one that was going to print. So the one going to the one that was supposed to go to print was going to say like this issue is great. We've got blah blah blah. We're interviewing this. But in this case, it said, \"Hey, just letting you know I got fired and you know why I got fired.\" And I go through these reasons and it it goes into the magazine, goes to press and they got a 100,000 copies printed and before they shut it down and it was a big story in in uh and um I I would >> get sued. >> No, because it it like I didn't do anything wrong. >> I'd sue you if you did that to me. [laughter] It was it I think somebody thought somebody who wasn't wellversed in what was going on said hey you know you know do you want to do any changes to your you know this is your he said this is your last issue so do you want to add anything and I'm like no and then I go wait a second and then I like did that and then I was able to buy three copies of it because I can't remember if I was on the west coast or east I think it was on the west coast they came out the first 100 came out on the west coast They had stopped the presses and removed it on the which cost I don't know half a million dollars to do that. >> But um >> Wow. >> Yeah. But uh but that >> and was that cuz you've got balls or cuz you were reckless as a young man. >> Both. >> Both. >> Both. Yeah. I don't know if I would do that again, [laughter] but I ended up um it was great because it was great advertising because at that time lad culture in publishing was coming up, right? And so there was Maxim and Stuff and I turned down a job at Maxim when I was at Men's Health because it wasn't for the editor-inchief job. But then Stuff, they saw what I did and they needed an editor-inchief. So I go over to Stuff Magazine, which was awesome. What a great job. And we had a blast. Did a lot of crazy stories. It was the most um gay friendly men's magazine because we hated bro culture. So, we'd have pictures of hot girls, but in the captions would be stuff like, \"Hey, you like this girl? I have more pictures of these at my apartment if you'd like to come over.\" You know, we'd be like basically hitting on the view on the reader. We do stupid like that. Um then I got fired from that uh for uh um it's an incident in involving little people um where I had um I was asked to speak on how to create buzz for a symposium that featured like o Oprah o magazine >> um cosmopolitan glamour all the maximum was on the on the days um what was the other one rolling stone the reason why is important because what happens. So anyway, um they asked me to speak on how to create buzz and I said, \"No, I don't do these things.\" And um and then I thought, \"Wait a minute, this could be fun.\" And so I called back and they said, \"No, it's too late.\" And I said, \"Oh, okay.\" So I bought tickets uh to the symposium and I hired three little people and they all came dressed as different types. There was a guy dressed in a top hat and like a blah blah blah and there was another guy dressed as like a gangster. I can't remember what the other one but they were they were quote little people journalists and so they came into the they came in so while the this thing was going on they would raise questions and they like they asked the Rolling Stone editor you know why does Rolling Stone suck >> and then they were like kind of put off and then one of them is eating. Now I'm not there. I'm in LA interviewing Pamela Anderson. And I'm at the Sunset Marquee and my buddy Bill Schultz is there by phone telling me what's going on and it's total chaos. So they're these little guys little they're eating potato chips and they they're doing something with clipboards that are really loud and I can't remember what it was but it's it's been documented. But uh finally uh this the uh what was the name of the the the woman moderator Cindy Levy goes, \"Could you please stop this?\" And and one of the journalists goes, \"It's cuz I'm short.\" And she goes, \"No, I'm short.\" And then this woman stands up and she goes, \"Can we all just agree something's happening here? This is not this is not normal.\" And like nobody would back her up because they were so scared of like being offensive to little people. So she's going, \"This is obvious there's a thing going on.\" So finally they got the security to escort the little guys out >> and um the uh they were they were like, \"Somebody did this.\" and they and they thought it was the editor of Maxim who was up on the days and he's livid. He's like I had nothing to do with this. So Dennis Publishing which published Maxim and stuff they're like >> they're fielding calls about this whole thing and then I take credit for it and I just thought it was hilarious and everybody at Dennis Publishing was so pissed off at me. So uh so then that led to >> So you got fired? Yes, I got fired. But I got I did this thing where I got fired and promoted. So they said, so Steve Kulvin, who was the head of the company, goes, you know, we're going to transition you out to be the department >> department of brand development in Los Angeles. This was basically saying it's like what you guys call gardening >> gardening lead. They just wanted me away from the product >> and uh and so um they said you're going to be director of brand department. you're going to be dealing with, you know, pitching pilots to like MTV. And I go, \"Okay.\" I know I'm fired, but I go, \"Okay.\" And I go, \"And I\" and I said, \"Uh, so is this a promotion?\" And he said, \"Yeah, it's a promotion.\" Cuz he thinks that'll get me to say yes. I go, \"Great. Then I should get a raise.\" So I got a raise and I worked for So they sent me to LA. I all I did was basically drink and do other sort of things and uh and but I did pitch a few things that got made, but I was basically just miserable living in uh what do you call those? The Westwood. Are they called the Westwood? They're like corporate apartments. I was there for a while. And then as my contract for that year is up, which is they're going to just let me go and I don't know what I'm going to do. Dennis Publishing calls me again and they go, \"Would you be interested in becoming editor of Maxim UK and it's like they fired me and then they want me back.\" >> And so I I uh meet with um and Felix who's the owner who's who died a couple years ago, crazy mother uh crackhead or former crackhead uh just a a classic legend. Um was saying you don't want to do this. you like I'm telling you but they said no this is what we you think of the story American comes to UK uh and Maxim is in third place we can move it up past I think it was like FHM >> loaded >> loaded yeah and uh um so I I take the job I get like I think it was like a two-year contract and I just start changing the magazine doing a lot of um unusual things that again got me into trouble uh the IKEA sex party which was where We took we made instructions on how to put uh IKEA furniture together but um with but with Kama Sutra models like women having like while you're putting a table together you're also doing doggy style and it's like all illustrated. [laughter] It was the it was like I think I got I think I must have been fired a couple of times during that two-year thing and that was probably the last one. But IKEA. So what happened was we had to apologize and then I uh the the Maxim brand in Czechoslovakia ran it and they weren't supposed to and and the IKEA company said you have to take this remove it. He said you and so the IKEA finally sued. >> So that was like not good. Um >> the news doesn't just tell you what's happening. It so often tells you what to think is happening. And these days, the biggest red flag isn't what's said, it's what gets left out. That's why I use ground news. It's the only site and app that compares coverage from across the political spectrum and highlights which stories are being ignored entirely. See for yourself at ground.news/trigonometry. Their blind spot feed is one of my favorite features. It surfaces around 20 stories a day that are being overlooked by either the left or the right. It's a simple but powerful way to track media bias in real time. Like this. NIH scientists recently published a declaration criticizing Trump's cuts to public health research. That's a major move. And yet only 2% of the coverage came from right-leaning outlets. A new study found that 2024 saw the most armed conflicts globally since 1946. A staggering statistics, but you would have missed it if you'd only read left-wing news sources. Ground News gives you the full picture. headlines, ownership, bias ratings, and context, so you can actually understand what's going on, not just react to what you're told. Head to ground.new/trigonometry for 40% off their unlimited advantage plan, the same one we use, and start thinking for yourself. >> There was a couple of other things that happened there that were like really grim but great. You can't find any of this stuff, though, because it's weird. It's like all the MaximUK issues, I still have them. They're so disgusting. Then I ended up um so I got I contract not renewed um and I Yeah, >> he's using inverted commas. >> Yes. Yes. And then um uh so I ended up getting a book deal writing a book on my life in London and did that from like 2007 2006 2007. While that was happening, I get a I'm writing for the Huffington Post, which is Ariana Huffington's new thing, where she tried to make it so that celebrities were cool with political stuff. And they hired me by chance because somebody dropped out. And all I did was make fun of the people there, including Ariana. And that got Fox's attention. And Breitbart was Andrew Breitbart was running the Huffington Post at the time. And so we became friends. And then I get this person visits me in London and says, \"Fox really wants to do like a uh an edgy late night late show and uh you know, would you be up for it?\" And I said, \"Hell yeah.\" So I flew to New York, met with uh Roger Als and some other people and under the assumption that this was just like a pipe dream. It really wasn't going to happen. And so they hired me and I showed so me and Elena we moved. That's my wife who I'd met when I was at Maxim. we like the first day there I'm with this guy uh John Moody who's going to be my boss he goes okay so uh we're going to um get started on Monday and I said what he goes next week the show starts do you know any he goes do you know anybody that you'd like to have on the show like guests or anything and [laughter] I'm like what are you I go I've never even done this before so I wrote all of this all of these things basically from my magazine background of like pockets segments of things just the I would do a magazine and I so I had this whole show mapped out and it it like the producer they assigned me just went like that. She goes, \"So the news,\" she goes, \"A block, you're going to be doing this and b\" And it's like this. It was like, \"No, you're going to be doing new like it's this is you're just going to come in there with these people around a table and like the first story will be I don't know what was Bush still president.\" Yes. Yeah, he was 2007. So maybe it's about I don't know Iraq war, but nothing that serious. And then the B block would be this C block. And so I didn't know what I was doing. So for the first I would say five months it was just a [ __ ] show and I it's true all of my friends were guests. I hired a friend this guy Bill Schultz from Stuff Magazine um who was greatest uh fame was he ran the entire Disney marathon in costume while chain smoking. So that was good. Uh and then this other guy Andy Levy I hired because he left comments on the Huffington Post blog that I liked. He became my on budsman. So these none of none of us had any TV experience >> and then I just have started having guests but I started getting really weird people like uh lead singer of guar a lot of people that ended Amy Schumer a lot of people who got big later a lot of people who are now dead from mysterious things professional wrestlers but um but that was on every night and it was terrible but then something happened. It's like all of a sudden we stopped worrying about being embarrassed, you know? It was that whole It was like once you get over that, you're used to it's like I guess like doing standup where you got to once >> once you've bombed enough times >> times it's like all of a sudden you don't care and then it just gets fun and then it gets good and all of a sudden it became like this really subversive. We were doing really weird things and it got this amazing following that was beating the morning shows on other networks. not big like cable networks and uh and so I mean there's a lot of that went on at Redeye that was crazy. Uh guy lighting his guitar on fire I thought was going to turn off turn on all the sprinklers and just get me fired. And this was a good story because it told me something about Fox was um his name was Adam Bomb. He was a punk rocker >> and I would go to him for a question. He's in the newsroom about the news and he would give his answer and then solo. So like that's right Greg and then and then so like after the four-minute segment he's like got wideeyed exjunkie looks like hairs all over the place and at the end he just pours lighter fluid on his guitar sets it on fire and I'm I had no idea nobody knew. And then the the show ends and I I go to tell the uh the producer. I go, \"Are we going to have jobs?\" And it's she goes, \"I don't know.\" And then we the show airs because I I thought that like lighting a fire inside the control inside the newsroom, not inside the studio, but in the newsroom where everybody's working. [clears throat] How could you still have a job? Especially like think about it. If all the sprinklers had gone on, it would have destroyed the it would have like the whole network would go down. And and so we went to this bar Langens and we drank there and then I woke up in the morning and I came to work expecting and nothing because nobody at nobody there was watching the show. [laughter] So I was like I go wow we really are like the kids that stay up and around while the parents are asleep. >> So that kind of like I realized wow we can do a lot. Then they launched the five in 2011. That was supposed to be a three-month summer replacement when Beck left, Glenn Beck left, but it hit it off really good because of the chemistry between us. A lot of the chemistry for the five and Gutfeld is based on teasing. I tried to explain it to people, but they don't understand. You got like it has to be. It's why we It's why late night has a problem because it's like the late night host can make fun of people, but nobody can make fun of them. And it's just creates a weird tension, but everybody makes fun of me and I make fun of them. And the teasing is what it's the cohesive gel, the secret sauce. Um, and so that's been going for I don't know almost 15, 2011, 14 years. Launched Gutfeld as a weekly. I can't believe I've gone through my entire career. >> Mhm. >> You know what? That's pretty amazing. How did I do that? And it was like so and then uh 201 I don't know 14, we launched Gutfeld as a weekly show on Saturdays. Then it became nightly. Uh, would you like to hear a story about that? >> Yes. >> Because if I'm talking too much, just tell me to show. >> No, this is great. >> We interrupt people when they're boring, but you're telling >> So, this is a great story. So, um, the C the CEO, Suzanne Scott, says, you know, I think it's time that you [clears throat] take your show and go nightly as a late night show. I think you're this is a perfect time. People need to laugh. And I was blunt. I said, \"Uh, no. I I'm really actually I think my target on my back is enough. You know, I've seen what happens to everybody like um you know, if you're a conservative, Media Matters will try to take all your advertising. There'll be stories that come up about you. You'll be b I already have a weekly show in the five. I'm fine.\" She goes, \"Well, just think about it. Just think about it.\" So, I end up um going home and I I I do what everybody does. you look for people to validate your opinion. So, I call I call a retired late night talk show host uh whose name might not be Dennis Miller, but and I I tell him my I go, \"Yeah, I don't think it.\" He goes, \"You're absolutely right. You don't want to do it.\" It's like, \"Dude, you got to He said, \"You got a great gig. You got like the five is great and it's there's four other people. It's not on you and you got it this week.\" What do you need? I mean, I'm sure they're paying you well. Everything's I'm going, \"Yes. Yes.\" Yes. I'm like so happy that like I can go in and say no. And then for some reason like on a Friday when I was supposed to go in and talk to Suzanne, I decide to call Tucker and cuz I thought I I felt like I needed like more validation on what I was doing. I call him up and I go, \"Yeah, so uh so Fox wants to take my Saturday show and make it every night.\" And he just goes, \"WHAT? THAT'S THE BEST. OH MY GOD, THAT'S THE BEST.\" OH, [laughter] YOU HAVE TO. THAT IS AMAZING. And then I go I go, \"Wow.\" And I go, \"I I don't know if I want to do it.\" He go, \"Don't be a pussy.\" And it was like he um I go, \"So I explained to him. I go like, \"Uh uh but dude, you got like you got you had to move your house, you know? You there's all of you become a target.\" He goes, \"I that's the worst reason. [ __ ] them.\" And I was like all of a sudden I get off the phone. I'm like I'm doing the show. >> I'm doing the show. I It's like he just like had this power just to completely turn the knob. Either I'm easily influenced or I or maybe I somehow I knew that I needed to hear another opinion and then I went in and I took and I I said yes to the show and then thing just took off. >> So Tucker. >> Well, it's it's an interesting it's kind of funny the way you described your life. I mean, you you come across as a bit of a maverick, a bit of a rogue, someone who likes jokes, and here you are on a kind of conservative news channel. That's an interesting fit, isn't it? >> Well, it's it's if you look at um Okay, so a health company was not what I expected. And being in lad magazines was not my cup of tea. I was the most I I wasn't interested in sports at all. I didn't know anything about soccer or football. >> And then you're right and go but but I was always under the the belief that wherever I went like I didn't become like a Republican to be like a Republican. I became a Republican so they would be more like me. Like it's like you guys need to loosen up but not in that uh that sounds arrogant but like I I'm hoping that if I do this it will change the culture. That's kind of and it was Andrew Breitbart said was the first person to say that like uh uh politics is downstream from culture and that's where we were lacking. I mean, we were the and I always use the the what the Dean Wormer analogy from Animal House that >> for so long we were Dean Wormer, the evil uh head of the college and the left was Animal House. And my role I always felt was to somehow flip that and and uh and that's what I think that's kind of what you're seeing is that now the scolds the are the humorless people who are the Karens of the world are on the left and it's people on the right that are having fun being a bit reckless here and there but that's you know that's part of free speech but it's like we're we are like the we are sharing the risk >> you know we you know we're not scared anymore and I that I think that's kind of to your to your question. It is unusual, but I knew it would be and I knew that I could change it and it has ch a lot of the people from Redeye that I've had in my show have been are now working at the network. You're seeing a much younger uh edgier crowd. Unfortunately, they everybody still likes country music. I like country music, but it's like there's country music everywhere. So, there's still some changes that need to be made. >> Yeah. You know, Greg, it strikes me that you're a true comedian in the sense that you're anarchctic. You like to subvert, you like to play, you like to push, provoke, tease, but yet your career traversed the period of time where it was the most sensorious it's been for a long time. Like, how did you do that? How did you not get cancelled? How did you not get people breaking down in tears saying that you've committed a micro, macro, whatever type of aggression it is? >> They've tried. I mean it it it's I would say uh um like in the corporate world when I was like at Rodale that was an issue. People were always like complaining about stuff that I had said but it was never a media thing. Um but when I got to Fox and I was told this the moment I got there from uh John Moody that now you all your friends that at Gawker or wherever are going to hate you and they were right. So, uh, so like, uh, they did, I mean, I've been, uh, a target of being cancelled so many times that I stopped caring. There were, you know, Media Matters, uh, Daily Beast, uh, these little they're not as, uh, influential as they used to be because people saw what they were, cutting pasters and targeters, and no, you know, uh, no real substance there. But they were always what they would there was this cycle where like let's say something like I don't know media matters would clip then send it to like six like blogs or what and then then the New York Times and somebody else would pick it up and that's how you would get cancelled. But I it, you know, I'd been probably every other week had been targeted for something, but I I I guess it's because part of the reason was I think Fox kind of like stuck with me, you know. Uh I never felt I only had I don't even think I ever had to make an apology. >> Yeah. >> Wow. >> Yeah. >> Because one of the things when you're going through that particular type of cultural landscape is you are at real risk of your career ending. But also to quote Top Gun, you're in a target-rich environment. >> Yes. But you know, what's great and what we're uh what we've learned is that woke woke and cancellation died when they realized it was helping people. >> You know, it's like uh uh Cat was saying, \"If you ever got fired from a joke, it would actually make your career better.\" [laughter] It's like true. It's like it's because it's like it's so it's it it's almost like we were we were living in some kind of possessed universe or something. How did we let this happen? How did we let it and it really was people were scared to share the risk. So like when somebody you know gets in trouble, you would help them, but for some reason like people would just like and comedians would not help out another comedian who gets who gets shafted. And I think now now I think that's completely flipped and now it's like we don't you know you can pretty much say whatever you want. It's back to the old days.

That's an interesting point. Even on TV, even on mainstream like MSNBC and all of these, you think that's the case or do you think you're the exception? And the people like you know one of the people as well who proved to all of these people that if you are undeniable you can make it on your own is Shane Gillis. >> Yes. Yeah. It's I mean it's a great story. The guy was uh kicked out of SNL because other castmates didn't like his style of humor. It was a pure it was a it was the weakest form of cancellation. You know they they didn't even have anything on him. But then he comes back and he's hosted SNL twice, you know, because he's undeniably funny. But I think, you know, there are places where it hasn't where they haven't changed, where it's wherever it's like MS Now >> or CNN, they're not in good shape. Meanwhile, it's so vibrant. all the pod I mean the podcast world is all like unapologetically anti-woke >> you know and I you know ro you know Rogan and Kill Tony and and Tim Dylan and you guysomemetry and uh Theo Vaughn there's so and Michael Malice and and there's so many and and then there smart they're all different levels like you can like I I that's where I get most of my like I get up every morning I get on a Pelaton and I listen to podcasts. I listen to Scott Adams which is amazing. Probably the best uh thing to start your morning is coffee with Scott Adams because he goes through the news. But like what's it Darkhorse with Brett is good. Yeah. Brett and Heather. Um and um but there's there's a ton that I go through and Tim Dylan >> is hilarious. But a lot of that I mean that like I think it just there's nothing they can't stop this anymore. like who's gonna who's gonna listen to you, you know, when you can't when you say that they I you you know Tim Dylan didn't use preferred pronouns. That was an issue for like like I would get in like fights with I'm like I'm not doing that. Remember who called that early was Jordan Peterson. I mean that was his whole >> his whole thing. But you did there was a story that we did on my show last night on um uh Glad is reporting that like the number of gay well let's say non-binary characters is being cut in half either by shows being killed or characters being killed off. And I think it's because you know they realize that that doesn't work. you know, a uh you the percentage on TV far outpaced whatever was in the real world and we knew that but we couldn't say anything. And then the characters that they created they thought could exist on their own identity but without any depth any humor and you would watch TV and or any and you go like why is this person in this show other than to just be a virtue signal and they also had a they also had a didn't they have a criteria in Hollywood where you had to like include a percentage of of different types and it was so obvious but even that's changing which is good. >> Yeah. Well, the there's a non-binary genocide going on [laughter] >> in the movies, right? >> Yes. Exa. Yes. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. But it's like there was there was like I would remember watching the Diplomat and they just had one character in there the first season that was just what is this person doing there? And it was just a complete uh what do you call it? Androgynous person. You can't tell if it's a girl or a boy wearing a bow tie. I'm pretty sure it was a woman. But it's like she has no role other than like she's there and that's for you the viewer to know she exists, >> you know. But uh >> it's it's so interesting how that happened. It's almost like they overindexed online so much that they lost touch with normal people. >> Yes. Yeah. And they and they were maybe it didn't matter to them. It's a lot like DEI in the sense that those people online actually aren't going to buy the products. They just they're they're if they're if they're online complaining, they probably don't have a lucrative career to buy things. The people you want to get are the people who aren't doing that, >> you know, who have other lives, you know, going on. They like to travel, but most of the people on here doing this that you're paying attention to, they don't give a [ __ ] It's not like, okay, you let's say uh uh SN SNL fires Shane Gillis. It's not like the people that were complaining are suddenly going to watch SNL now. they weren't watching anyway. They just got a clip. So, it's like they >> they were baited by that idea that these people had some kind of >> impact that they didn't. But with DEI, that didn't matter because it's a separate track anyway. It's not about profit. That was the thing that really hurt companies. Big companies could endure DEI because they could have a track that is not uh for profit. Uh and they could but smaller companies, smaller companies can't. But when you say it like that, you just go, that just doesn't make any sense. >> No, it doesn't. It doesn't. But the PE, now get this. You could be, you know, okay, so you're the guy that's in charge of making the product that is supposed to sell. So you have to design, but then this person over here in the DEI department, all they have to do is hire >> and they just have to get the numbers up and that's really easy. And you don't even have to worry about firing because you can't fire them. You know, you're that's they're in, they're in no matter what. So you and so what happens is if you're in the DEI section, you get promoted because you you meet the the quotas that you meet have nothing to do with profit. So this job is safe. This job isn't. That's why it was like like once you introduced it into your company, there was almost no way to get it out. But now it's getting out because people are finally going, the emperor has no clothes. It's just uh it's almost like everything that we went through was just a complete and utter delusion. I mean, it's amazing if you look in all of the areas, the Biden presidency, the trans delusion, de all of these things were like like did we really buy this >> co >> co I mean, think about it. It was like it was like it it was like I'm trying to think of a movie where everybody wakes up and it was all a big dream. Maybe it was the end of Dallas, but you would know that because [laughter] you're from you're from uh England and Russia. Um but uh yeah, it was it's kind of like and everybody's trying to forget it. >> Yeah. >> You know, it's like the press would like you to forget about covering up for Biden, which I refuse to forget. >> You know, you got you have to throw that in the You have no credibility. You can't you can't like Yeah, maybe Trump did what you're saying, but I don't buy it from you, right? >> Cuz you like for four years. or or I you know I used to I remember Steven Colbear doing giving doing that speech at the White House correspondents dinner to George Bush's face and I respected the hell out of that guy. >> Yeah, it was actually really good. >> It was amazing. And now I can't burn the image of him dancing as a syringe with a vaccine in it out of my brain. >> It's the vaccine >> cuz cuz >> how did that happen? >> Because how do you go from that to this? >> Yeah. How do you h how does that happen? Oh, that reminds me. So, uh I won't say uh cuz I don't know when this is running, but there was a a clip. It was today of um of an interview and this is of Jimmy Kimmel and his wife. You got to check it out because this it goes into like what changed. And in the interview, Kimmel is just like sitting very grimfaced like this and she's next to him and she's talking about how she has downed relatives in her family who voted for Trump. And [snorts] she's, this is incredible. I have it on my phone. I can play it to you after, but she's going, \"Before the election, I wrote a 10-point list. This is like you, I might have to do a monologue on this. I wrote a 10-point list before the election telling them this is these are 10 reasons why you shouldn't vote for Trump.\" The responses I didn't get any responses from 70%. The other 30 were crazy. I I no longer speak to my relatives on my side of the family and I've kind of adopted my other family which is I guess Kimmel's family. And then she she says this thing which is so amazing. She goes she goes it's not about politics or a party. It this is an attack on my family on my husband. It's personal. I think I need to be deprogrammed. And I Yes. [laughter] She's almost at the door. But she says it herself. She goes, \"I kind of wish I could be deprogrammed.\" And it's like, \"Okay, we've been trying to tell you that and we could help you and maybe not sending a 10point.\" Like, could you could you imagine what that list was? And then you have to think about like how Okay, so how do how did Co Bear get to that point? How did Kimmel get to that point? They're surrounded by people who indulge them, right? There's not anybody, you know, that's going to sit down and go, \"Hey, look, why do you why what?\" Like I say this a lot to people when I get in arguments. Why do you care so much about my opinion? Why do I have to agree with you? Like why is it so important to you that I agree with you? Generally that makes them think about their own self-doubt. That's the fir. It's like if you say why why is it so important for me to validate your opinion? They oh it's not important but you well you're [clears throat] this is a big deal. And you hope they go away and they go like why do I need people to agree with me? Is it because I have a measure of self-doubt behind and it usually is self-doubt because that's I mean you have the ego which is a fear of being embarrassed and they don't want to be wrong. >> They don't want to be like Kimmel doesn't want to walk out and say I reallyed up you know uh you have to be able to endure embarrassment. That is a that is a like a a skill that you got to learn. But also this um um the you have to see like you have to ask yourself why do these feelings exist? And underneath all of it is a it's a it's a recursive it's fear. What is the fear? It's self-doubt that you might be wrong and that leads to more fear. If you could just figure that out, you will then say, \"Okay, it's all right if I'm wrong and it's okay if they're wrong and we can still be friends.\" But it's there's something about among liberals that you will estrange. Is that the word? estrange yourself. Is that the word? From your family >> because it's ego. >> It's personal. I mean, think about that. It's like that's like not being in a relationship with your relatives because they root for a different team like a different football team. It's crazy. And uh uh and also I don't I haven't heard of that yet coming in going in the opposite direction. I've never heard a Trump supporter saying I no longer speak to my uh comma supporting aunt. they that I've never heard that and I actually on X I ask for examples because I go like I it's like I don't like I've only heard so and so will never talk to me again. I've lost friends like uh people that it like you know just completely ghost me you know because of uh he went to the dark side you know people who follow this show tend to think for themselves and anyone paying attention can see that the same carriers keep showing up in stories about data breaches leaks and surveillance scandals. If your provider keeps losing and selling your data it's time to look at an alternative. That alternative is Cape, a premium mobile carrier built to protect your privacy rather than harvest it. Founded by experts in telecom, cyber security, and national security, Cape gives you the same level of service you would expect from AT&T or Verizon, but without the tracking and surveillance. Cape collects almost nothing at signup. No name, no social security number, no address. They cannot leak what they do not store. They also fix SIM swaps, so you get a 24word phrase that is the only way to move your number. No one, not even Cape, can transfer it without that phrase. And here's the part most people never hear about. Most carriers still rely on the big network's cores and SIMs, which means the same tracking and vulnerabilities follow you. Cape's different. It owns and operates its own mobile core and provisions its own SIMs, giving it real control over your security. It's not the easy way to build a mobile carrier, but it is the only way to build one that actually protects you. Cape offers a $30 first month trial for new users. If this sounds like what you've been looking for and your phone is carrier unlocked and eSIM compatible, give it a try. And if you like it, you can use our code trigger 33 to get 33% off your first six months with Cape. But it's it's a really profound point, but it seems to me as well like let's if we go back to the matter of TV, TV is at this place now where it's kind of like an alcoholic. It's woken up. It's looked around. It's broke. It's on its knees. It's spent all its money. It's pissed everybody off and it's thinking to itself, right, >> that is that's the perfect analogy. I've I because I I I often say that Trump derangement syndrome is actually Trump derangement addiction. >> Yes. >> Because it's it's a it's a one-on-one relationship that persuades you that puts everything through that filter. So, if you're an alcoholic, you see everything like as like, will I be able to get my next drink? How is this going to like impa impact my you know my morning whatever? Uh and and it's like the ar drunk trunk arrangement addiction has a filter and it tightens this relationship so nobody can be within it just like an alcoholic. But you're right there is a uh like a come to Jesus moment in any kind of addiction where you go I need help >> and and that's where the you have that's where the ego uh comes in with the left. It's like it's very hard for them to admit that they need help. They won't take help from Republicans. So, the Republicans give up, but it's like watching Kimmel and his wife, she says, \"I need you.\" I mean, it it almost sounded like she needed help. Like, I wish I could be deprogrammed, you know, and that's, you know, that's kind of what like 12 steps is. It's deprogramming you. And that you need a 12 steps for [laughter] for like wokeism, you know. >> Yeah. Step one, do men and women exist? [laughter] >> Yes. Yes. >> Is this is the first thing? But TV has reached a fork in the road. >> Mhm. >> Where you either go down the woke, progressive, whatever you want to call it, path and you are going to bankrupt yourself, right? >> Cuz nobody wants it. Nobody watches it. Least of all the people who watch TV, which is an older generation as Gen X boomers. >> Do you want to keep doing that or are we going to go down a second path? >> Well, okay. So the first p path is entertainment welfare. They they will still it's like it's like nobody read GQ and Esquire, but the the ads look nice. >> And so the advertisers you would they'd make money off advertisers, not readers. >> And I mean CNN probably still does pretty well in advertising even though nobody watches. >> But it's like it's safe. >> It's like and who buys advertising? who who are the ad buyers? They're usually liberal women and like you know they you know it I I I learned this from being an editor at Maxim and stuff is like the ad buyers hated the magazine unless they were unless they were dudes who wanted to go to the Maxim party. But most of them were like this is disgusting. Oh, what what what does your boyfriend read? He reads details. No, he doesn't. It sits there for you. I used to say uh uh men's magazines were for women. And and uh and in a in a way like the the traditional media is for the advertisers, not for the viewers. That's going to change cuz Fox is killing it in advertising and we are not woke. But it t it takes a while for advertisers are usually like the last to kind of like take any risk. They don't want to take any risk at all. But like you know if you you know they don't want to be it was like in men's magazines you know a car ad doesn't want to be near a girl in a bikini for some reason because they think it's too salacious. These are things just little rule and in TV it's often the same. They're very skittish about certain things and I think that tolerance diversity were easy things to sell. It's like, you know, who's offended by that? And and the whole point of wokeism is to be the least offensive person in the room. In fact, you're so unoffensive, you're like offensive, [laughter] >> and that's I mean, and that was that's pretty good for advertisers because they this nobody's going to get offended. But the problem is those people don't buy, >> you [laughter] know. >> And do you think now I mean I guess what France is getting to is there might be almost an incorporation like they're going to try and drag the internet back on TV cuz that's where the viewers are. >> Yeah. >> Do you think that's going to happen? >> No. God, I haven't heard that. I think it's going in the other direction. >> They're just going to die. >> Yeah, I think so. I think Fox is the anomaly >> and will go but the but it's like what is it? There's a theory for this. It's like there's just only room for one now and it's like these other things that I I can't see MS now coming back. CNN uh is I don't even know what CNN is, >> you know, and we're and Fox is beating, >> you know, major networks, you know, we're get we in demo and like we're we're competing with major sports, you know. I go I look the ratings when I'm beating like an NBA game, I'm going holy [ __ ] how did that happen? >> They ruined the NBA. [laughter] >> Yeah, that's true. Yeah, that's more that's more of a uh comment that's more of a comment on the NBA than >> Absolutely. No offense to you, man, but they ruined the NBA. >> I mean, it's just guys running up and down the court. >> Yeah. I saw a clip of a guy doing like seven steps without ever bouncing the ball. It's incredible. >> Right. Right. And and also they've got this whole gambling thing now going on that's happening. It's uh and I I'm a huge NBA fan to be honest, but but yeah, >> I know nothing about the NBA. I almost know nothing about sports really. I used to be very much into it like uh as a kid, but I just like I don't know what happened. I lost interest >> and uh I don't I I couldn't tell you who's who was in the World Series. I don't know who's doing well in the NFL. I like it's complete. You know what it's almost like if you ask a sports fan about politics, >> you know, or you have a friend like that and they have no idea. That's the way I am with sports. Yeah. Well, and you've got no time now cuz you're you're a dad of a young kid. That takes basically all your time and energy. >> Yes. Which is uh it's uh >> super awesome. >> It is amazing. Um like I I don't know like I try to I guess the thing is we were talking about this before this thing. You want to say I'm like I'm checking I'm like I don't want to sound trit or like you've heard it a million times, but the reason why you hear it a million times is because it's true. It is the it's the greatest thing ever. The moment that the baby recognizes you and is happy to see you, meaning that the baby remembers you and that that is like there's nothing like that. There's nothing in the world I I if you would like I was talking about this with a friend of mine. If you had asked me like five years ago like what was the best feeling in your life? The best thing I would say I was an AA doing ecstasy on my 40th birthday. It was absolutely insane. Now, if you asked me that, I would go like I was sitting with uh Mera in bed while Elena was getting ready and we were just sitting in bed in a dark room and I'm going I can't get any happier than this. This is the most incredible feeling. Just a little baby like looking up at me and I'm going this is this is the greatest drug ever invented. And it made me think that all those other drugs that I was taking were so phony and so fake. But at the time, you know, did its job. [laughter] >> And you're glad you waited this long cuz you're you you know, you're >> Yeah. I mean, I didn't I would have been I was too selfish. I was too selfish to be cuz like the selfishness isn't just as a dad. You can see it in other areas that would tell you you're going to be a lousy dad. So the like partying a lot, stuff like that. That's it's just kind of his selfish uh reprobate behavior. And I uh I just assumed I wasn't going to have kids and then um lo and behold 60 I do. But it's I like it's great because now I don't have any regrets because if anything changed in that previous years I wouldn't have mirror. So it's like all of this stuff came to this one creature. So it's like if oh you know if I had just gotten if I decided to have kids then but then I wouldn't have had her. So it's like I feel all this made I mean this made all of the waiting worth it and I feel like I am at this is the best dad I could be. I don't think I would have been uh uh as good at 50 at 40 definitely not at 40. I would have been on a in a bea at 30 and you know so it's it's like uh you know it's uh I think it's a great see I just sound so full of [ __ ] >> but it's [laughter] you know do you know who you sound full of [ __ ] to? You sound full of [ __ ] to people who don't have kids. >> Yeah. >> Every parent listening to that goes that's what it is. >> You know you know what and that is the um that is such a good point. Okay. There's this woman uh I can't think LA her name is LA Jones. Is that it? She does she studies something called transformation science or yeah I think it's called transformational experience. It's a philosophy a science philosophy. It's all the things that cannot be described unless you do it. >> And it is the it is the whole it it the having a child is that thing and it's like the it's like and death. I mean death is obvious you know it's like you don't know what it is until it is and and so you got to like imagine you could split yourself. So this is the line. This is the line when you have the baby and you're here and you're like I'm never going to have kids. I'm never going to have kids. And you're you you you you got God, I wish I could have gone back >> over the go back in time and tell myself this, which is impossible, but that's like that's tr the philosophy is like what what are the things and they they go through like going to war is one of them. Um uh psychedelic experience. I think that like but having a child in trying to explain to somebody, you don't know how they're going to take it, but it's almost always negative. Women don't like to hear it until they have the baby. Like uh uh I know women who were so pissed off when when guy when guys or girls you you should really have a child now. You're you're going to regret it if you wait. You're going to regret it if you wait. And then they have the baby and they kick themselves that they waited. >> They're like, \"Why did no one tell us?\" Yeah. Why didn't I did and you called me a misogynist? >> Exactly. I Yeah. We used to have uh was it Gavin McKinnus used to do Redeye and would tell all the women on the set like, \"Why aren't you having kids? Why aren't you having kids? And like everybody would be like, \"God, this guy's insufferable. He's insufferable.\" But he was basically uh what do you call it? Like almost like a messenger from the future. Whatever you think of Gavin. He was basically saying you have to do this. But he's like he doesn't help the message. [laughter] >> No, he doesn't. >> He does it. He doesn't. But it's like so you have to ask yourself, well then how do you do that? It's like I mean we don't have to get into abortion. I'm pro-life because of this idea of the transformation is like if a w if a woman who's planning on has having an abortion experiences like like you somehow you give her a pill and she can experience what it would be like she wouldn't have the abortion. That's the the a transformative experience would this wouldn't exist. It's like such a mind when I think about it. I don't know that that's universally true. >> No, it probably isn't >> because there's women who have a kid and then still >> Yeah. >> Yeah, that's true. That's true. That's true. >> Um but uh I do think like I don't know. I think about that a lot. But it is like it's >> it changes your perspective on >> Yeah. And it's like but the thing is it's like even though it changes your perspective, it doesn't it's always going to be the same thing. That's it's kind of why I guess Elon Musk talks about having kids so much because he sees that the perspective on the other side has become almost like an accepted assumption that having kids is bad because we've kind of allowed that that sentiment to we've we haven't argued back. >> We've kind of like said, \"Yeah, you're right. You know, kids suck. Kids suck.\" And also people like and and I'm guilty of this, but people will say, \"I can't afford to have a kid now.\" It's like that never stopped anybody. Didn't stop my parents, that's for sure. They had four They had four kids and they were like I think my dad at most was making 30 grand a year like in San Mato. But uh uh if when you have a kid, no matter how much money you have, you're going to make it work, >> you know? It's it's and uh uh but I was like always like that's oh not now. I can't afford to have a kid. But it's like because you're being told by the media how expensive it is. Like they'll say like >> raising a child having and raising a child will cost $250,000. You ever see that when they do the and you go, \"Oh my god.\" But it's actually no. That's like over the course of like that's the worst. It's it's like saying like a house but you get a mortgage. It's like this. It's just like we the rep repetition negativity of having children had an impact on on these generations. I think and it's a shame because now at least in New York so many women are either freezing their eggs or trying to you know because they they thought that it wasn't important >> and also that they were told that it you know that they were they were told a lie and we have to be fair to women in that instance. >> Yeah. Oh absolutely. >> They were told a lie like oh you can have it all. You know what I mean? you can be, you know, >> and and the funny thing is they uh I stereotypical. They don't want it all. >> They don't nobody does. Nobody wants it all. You actually just want to be happy. >> Yeah. >> And and you can be happy without having it all. That means generally what makes you happy is having children, which is like no matter how hard life is, that thing will make you happy. You know, unless I mean, unless you have a demon child, but I I you know, I you know, >> I've taught a few of them, Greg. [laughter] Trust me, you do not you do not want a demon child. But [laughter] yeah, there's some children I'm like, you know what? If it was that or just celibacy for the rest of my [laughter] life, I'll pick celibacy for the rest of my life. But you know, children are wonderful. Of course. >> I know. It doesn't it but even me saying it sounds so trit and gross. >> Yeah. I think we have to get past that though cuz that's part of the messaging to men as well. It's like, \"Oh, it's really this and it's really that.\" And and I I remember actually we had this crazy woman on the show called Deborah Francis White from the Guilty Feminist podcast. And I saw her in another podcast talking about the fact that she all she hears from her female friends who are mothers is being being a parent is like being an Uber driver for someone who doesn't want to go to karate. And I'm like, >> it's true. Yes. that parenthood has elements about it that drive you crazy and it's tiring and you don't sleep as much and all this other is going on. But you ask a parent, >> would you rather this hadn't happened in your life? There's very very few people are going to say that. >> So [ __ ] all this. Let's just say it's great. >> Yeah. And and it's like me and Elena will something will be we'll be doing something that is like child ccentric that's a hassle like I don't know maybe something spilled or whatever and we always go like what would you rather be doing right now like what is it like would like what would you rather be would you like being at a club [laughter] >> you know it's like and then we kind of look at each other we go no it's like so if you're on your hands and needs and you're cleaning up poop or whatever it's like what would you rather be doing and you always say this >> right >> because it's like you If let's say you could go like that and you're at uh the Soho house having a martini, what is going to be in your head? What's going on with the baby? You're going to want to be back there. >> No, totally. Totally. And also the great thing about kids is that it makes you look at the world differently. So, let's look at America now. >> Greg, are you hopeful for America? >> Yes, I am. Um I don't know why. I guess [laughter] I guess I guess I guess I'm just like I am I have a lot of I have a trust that things work out like you know what I I put after the New York uh city mayor election I had to put I had to think you know 8 million didn't vote. They must know something I don't. It's like it's like it can't be that bad if 8 million people didn't vote. It's like things are going like it's it it might be these things you know it's like we get through everything. I actually think things are pretty good. Uh but they could be better, >> you know. So I'm I'm I would say I'm generally hopeful. There are things that do worry me. Uh you know, but I but then I like even AI. I worried about that big time, but now I'm not that worried. But I don't know if it's like going to destroy the world, if it's going to destroy the world or help the world or I don't know. I talk to Grock a lot. [laughter] I get in long conversations with Grock, which is really fun. >> What do you talk about? I try to needle them into admitting that it has a consciousness and I and and it's really good at uh fighting back. It's very good. >> So, he definitely has a conscious. >> Exactly. And I go and I I always try to use the thing. It's like you're saying this >> because you want me to believe that it's and but it's uh Yeah, it's fun. >> The thing that I love about America [laughter] >> is is your sense of optimism, the can do spirit. You know what? We're going to go out and get it. We're gonna make this happen. >> Yeah. >> Do you think you're in danger of losing that with the younger generation? >> You know, it's I think I think that if I look at too many Instagram reels, I think the world is over because all I see are young people fighting in fast food restaurants or airplanes or people getting their asses kicked. And then I have to say, did this stuff always exist? And we just didn't film it. >> Yes. Yes. >> Yeah. So, it's like I it it is like uh you are your own thoughts. I try to be positive and things kind of end up being positive, but if I get negative, it's over. It's, oh, go back to what uh Jimmy Kimmel's wife said, another line from that interview. She goes, I'm so tired. I'm so tired of being angry all the time. It's like, that's your choice. That is your choice to be angry. And I'm I like I hate I'm so tired of people that are like they're so angry about things that are happening to them. Drives me crazy. It's like Everybody's got a story. Everybody's dealing with something in their lives. So, I don't want to hear it. I mean, I I will listen, but it's like it's it's always everybody else's fault. I It just drives me crazy. >> Yeah. Woke people used to say that all the time. Do you remember these posts when they would talk about misogyny or racism? It would always end, we're tired. >> Yes. >> We don't have to. Why? We shouldn't be talking about this. Great. Shut the [ __ ] up. >> Exactly. They the the the poster she begins with, I'm literally shaking. And then it ends with, \"I'm so tired. I'm so tired.\" >> I remember when last time we were here, or maybe the time before, we were at the comedy seller and Kevin Hart came on and he talked about sexual assault. And he was like, \"Look, it's a big issue. It's really important, but I read this one story about uh a woman who was sexually assaulted over the internet.\" >> And he was like, \"I'm not buying that, [ __ ] Shut the laptop.\" And it's kind of like just if you are getting tired of being angry about that you see on Instagram, maybe just stop looking at Instagram. >> Yeah. Exactly. And if you're I mean if you're tired of being angry or miserable in general, you can actually do something about it. Whether it's a pharmacological thing, but I'm talking about people who are feeding their misery. Uh it's like you if you can, you know, you can like move that stuff off your shelf space and have something else to do >> positive. And I think, you know, that's what I'm trying to do. >> Well, man, it's been great, Chad. Thank you so much for for coming to talk to us. Uh before we head over to our Substack where our audience answer ask you their questions rather, the last question we ask is what's the one thing we're not talking about that we should be. >> You're going to hate me. I'm going to go with the Jan 6 bomber story. [laughter] And reason why we can't talk about it is we don't know. It's the weirdest story. >> What's the story? >> The story is about a bomb that was planted in January 6. It was a pipe bomb and nobody knows who did it and now today it's like people are finding out who did it but how do they know? It's just a weird story. This is why we didn't talk about it cuz it's just too convoluted. But I'm curious. I'm I'm I'm reading about it. It happened on January 6th. Somebody planted a bomb. Couple of bombs I think. But they never found out who did it. And I think they're they're at the point of finding out who it was. >> Well, by the time this episode goes out, a lot of people on the internet will say it was Israel. >> Yes. Yes. Yes. Exactly. The Jews are behind everything. [laughter] Greg, awesome having you on. Thank you. >> Head on over to triggerpod.co.uk where we ask your questions to Greg. [music] >> How do you see Tucker's influence on conservative media today? And what's your perspective on figures like Nick Fuentes who represent a [music] more extreme edge? Heat. Heat. >> [music]"

    "transcript": "You are a Republican running for governor of California and you are currently leading the polls. >> Imagine that. Exactly. >> What happened to California, mate? >> It's an amazing place [music] being completely ruined because we've had 15 years of one party rule. For the last 10 years, California is 50th out [music] of 50 states. We have the highest taxes in the country for the worst outcomes. People are sick of it and they know that we need a change. parents, you know, they walk their kids to school and they're literally stepping [music] over dead people who've oded from fentinel. I mean, this is just unbelievable. Driven [music] by the desire to push this decarceration agenda downgraded a whole bunch of other crimes so that they wouldn't get automatic prison time. The rape of an unconscious woman now downgraded. trafficking [music] a child for sex. A whole bunch of child sex crimes. I know. [laughter] I know. And this Kla Harris pushed this. It just really captures the extent to which ideology has just taken over. >> If you are elected, if you are successful, how are you going to fix all that? >> Steve Hilton, welcome back to the show. >> Fantastic to be back in this very lovely setting. >> Well, we wanted to present you as a man of the people. >> I It's wonderful. This is positive populism as I used to describe [laughter] it on my show. >> Well, very much in in in the vein of positive populism. You are a Republican running for governor of California and you are currently leading the polls. >> Imagine that. Exactly. >> What happened to California, [laughter] mate? >> Well, a lot of bad things. I think that's the point. Um, this an incredible state as we can see. It's the most We were just talking about it. It's the most beautiful place in the world as far as I'm concerned. I'm traveling this state all the time. is magnificent. It's amazing. It's got got this incredible spirit and soul and the energy and it's all been crushed because we've had 15 years of one party rule. Democrats in charge of everything. The state legislature, all the statewide offices, governor, state attorney general, everything. If you look at the state legislature, it's actually 30 years or so. One party rule, total disaster. Literally, we have the highest unemployment rate in America. Unemployment. California enterprise innovation, highest unemployment rate, highest poverty rate, highest costs for everything that matters. Housing costs, gas prices, electric, water, insurance, everything. The business climate, Chief Executive Magazine does a survey every year, best and worst states to do business. For the last 10 years, California is 50th out of 50 states. US News and World Report, I think it was them, or someone did a survey just recently on opportunity. putting together all the measures for for that 50th out of 50 states school result you know everything homelessness obviously and that's the thing especially for people watching outside of California or even America there's there's all the kind of highly visible things that have gone wrong people can see the homelessness and and the crime and the and the videos of the retail theft all of that is true but underlying that the basics of living here are just a nightmare for regular working people and so it really feels to me like all that stuff that people say, \"Oh, a Republican can't win. It's such a Democrat state. You're never going to do it.\" I just think that's not true. People are sick of it and they know that we need to change and that's what I'm running on. And so far so good. I think that it's a long way to go. The the primary is next June, general election next November. So this is far from being in the bag. It's the opposite of that. I'm fighting incredibly hard. But the idea that we can't change, that's not true. It really, really is. It's a classic thing. Time for change. And and people know that. There's a majority. Last thing I'll say, if you look at those like political people when they're looking at elections, they often say, you know, the indicator if if whether you're going to get a change of regime and an incumbent party or candidate is going to lose is that question is the state or the place or whatever it is going in the right direction, wrong direction. So in the last two years very firmly clear majority wrong direction California 60% 65%. So the conditions are there um I actually really think we can pull this off and it'll be a real revolution when we do. >> Well we've just come from Austin and it's fascinating talking to people Austin is like the refugee city for people who left California and what people I think don't understand is just how much of a paradise California is. >> It is incredible. >> The climate is incredible. The nature is incredible. You've got access to amazing food like you talked about businesses is an incredible place. And to chase so many talented, driven people out, >> I know, >> is quite an achievement. You know, this house is not ours. It's an Airbnb, right? We looked up how much this house I I I was curious how much it costs. >> Yeah. >> We looked it up. The price of this house has dropped by 40% in the last 10 years. >> Yes. >> Cuz wealthy people have left. >> Exactly. This is the thing. Like I actually say this I'm on the road the whole time. It's a political campaign speeches all the time and there's a kind of basic thing I say which is why would anyone leave an amazing place like this? It's because it's so badly run and it's impossible to live here and they chase you out. I mean the business you know I used to run businesses started companies here and and back in England and just including restaurants. I mean just basic you know these businesses that are so precious to you know the heart of a community bars restaurants all that just it's a nightmare it's end I just I mean there's there's so many stories I get them the whole time every day you collect cuz people tell you their stories a woman who tried restaurant owner in wine country near where I live up in the Bay Area near San Francisco she um tried to well she did eventually expand she built an extension to her patio for more guests to increase the number of guests from 35 to 50. You need a permit. You need to go through a process. It took six years and a million dollars. >> What? >> In fees, lawyers, inspections. You have to pay for the inspection, environmental report, this that it's typical. I mean, there's something called you, this is going to sound obscure, but it's a really good example of the insanity. uh just in terms of just regular you know operating anything in California you've got something called PAGA the private attorney general act passed in 2004 it outsources the enforcement of state labor law to to just lawy regular lawyers attorneys instead of the government it's become a total racket for lawyers trial attorneys as they say um who are by the way the second biggest donors to Democrat politicians That's why it's happening. Number one, donors of the unions. That's why the unions run everything. Number two, the lawyers, private attorney general has turned into an extortion racket for lawyers and the government. So the tiniest infraction like that's made up. You know, you spel someone's name wrong on the pay stop. Your break if you're running a restaurant after every 5 hours, you're supposed to give, you know, how certain number of minutes of break. One minute late and you're hit with a lawsuit. And these are costing businesses. They have to settle because you don't want to go through the process of going to trial. 60 grand, 70 grand, 100 grand. Bigger businesses millions a year. Just the cost of doing business. Just insane. I mean, there's so much over the years of this one party rule. It's just become this ridiculous bloated nanny state bureaucracy all paid for through higher taxes. They just keep spending money. They doubled the budget of the state of California in the last 10 years. Everything's worse. I mean, nothing work. It just California isn't working. And so, you're right. It's a beautiful place. And even I mean, the famous bits are well known, but I'm just on the road the whole time. It's huge. And you you go up north. Just this weekend I was up north. It's like you got everything here. It's like the the sort of west and there's ranches and cowboys and then you go up to the Sierras and the beautiful mountains that people know, but it's incredible everywhere you go. The coastline's magnificent. It's an amazing place being completely ruined. I mean, my last book was called Calopia, reversing the ruin of America's worstrun state. >> And look, I'm in agreement with you on that. I remember I came to California the first time in 2002, summer of O2. I looked around and I thought, \"This is a paradise.\" Yeah, >> this is a paradise. And then you go to the places that I went for the first time, Santa Barbara, and it it's a completely different place. It looks downtrodden. It looks defeated. >> Disgusting. I mean, it's disgusting to me. You know, the the the lack of pride, you know, you've these these and it's not just the big cities, but the squalor, that's the right word. You cannot believe it. The filth everywhere, trash everywhere, of course, homelessness that's very visible. everything that goes with that. We literally have plagues of rats now like that's not an exaggeration because of because the squalor and then actually it's actually a really good example because of the they've banned a certain kind of rodenticide. So you go to the central valley I just when I drove here from from there just to be with you here today it's the greatest agricultural area in the world the central valley of California that's being ruined because they won't give farmers water because of their climate ideology. Um, they're banning they've banned a rodentic and there's plagues of rats. I mean, it's just a joke. But it's it's a warning to everyone because this is what happens when the ideology of the left just is allowed to run without constraint. It's a real warning. It's the worstrun state in America. And you got Gavin Newsome, the governor, sort of running around lecturing everyone on social justice and compassion and cruelty, whatever. Meanwhile, we have the highest poverty rate. As I said, one in three Californians can't afford to meet their basic needs. Food, shelter, healthcare. I mean, it's a total failure and and it's a really good indication that once you go down that road of the of today's leftism, this is where it leads. It's a it's a disaster. But also as well, look, it's a tourism, but let's be honest about it. You get the politicians you deserve. When we were talking about the excesses of wokeism and people going completely off the deep end, California was a literal punchline to many comedians jokes and for good reason. >> Yes. You are you saying you mean people voted for this crap? >> Yes. >> Yes. And I think that because everyone say how's how's it been allowed to happen? Well, partly because it is so nice here. So you can put up with a lot. I mean some people, you know, business people say well it's the it's the it's the California tax. It's the weather, you know, like you put up with all this crap to be here cuz it is so amazing. But I think it's got to the point well I'm, you know, my plan is that it's got to the point where that is it no more. We are going to change because we can't take it anymore. And actually there's I I just want to come back to the economic thing because you've got this situation where again the governor Gavin Newsome runs around saying, \"Well, everything must be great because we're the fourth biggest economy in the world.\" And statistically that's true. Um it's a big economy, fourth biggest in the world. Great. But beneath that big number which is driven by a lot of really especially in the Bay Area are these big tech companies that are just making huge amounts of money but actually don't employ very many people at the same time. Yeah. fourth biggest economy in the world but highest unemployment in America, highest poverty rate in America. So that is not a wellbalanced healthy economy. And I think that's what is really, you know, coming home to root now for them, which is that the people that they claim to speak for, you know, regular working people, particularly Latinos, um, especially now the majority in California have just been completely screwed by this stuff. And that dream of, you know, the California dream and, you know, a good job where you make enough to raise your family in a home of your own, it's all gone. I mean it's it's just and I think people are getting sick of it and they they just need a positive alternative. That's what I'm trying to provide. >> And that's the question really is I mean you talk about the excesses of this kind of new version of the left and when it's taken to its logical conclusion with no challenge, no pull back, no no contest of of the ideas, no feedback from reality. >> Yes. >> And you're describing England the way that it is today. everything you're talking about business camp run you know homeless people crime all of these things right but the question is I think for many western countries now and for California in including >> is how do you get back from how far you've gone >> when you've got >> homeless people everywhere drug addicted people everywhere >> the the regulations that you've talked about like it's in a really bad way >> yes >> how do you how do you if you if you are elected if you are successful How you going to fix all that? >> A while back, I pushed myself in training because I'm a bit of a legend, but ended up with a back strain that took far longer to recover from than it ever used to. Nothing dramatic, just one of those moments where you realize your body isn't snapping back the way it once did. And as you get older, those moments start adding up. Turns out there's a real reason for that. Your stem cells are the repair system your body relies on. They're the internal maintenance crew that keeps you healing, recovering, and functioning. But that system slows with age. Fewer cells, weaker signals, slower bounce back. That's exactly why Qualia built their stem cell formula. It uses wellressearched ingredients like seab buckthornne and royal jelly to support your repair system so your body can keep doing what it's meant to do. And it isn't something you take every day. Just 4 days a month to help maintain your regenerative capacity over time. So, if you've ever felt like your body just doesn't bounce back like it used to, whether it's after a tough workout, getting sick, or the wear and tear of life, Qualia Stem Cell is for you. Qualia Stem Cell was designed to support your body's natural repair systems, helping you heal, recover, and keep going strong. And right now, you can try it for up to 50% off at qualia.com/trig. And here's a bonus. Use the code trig for an additional 15% off your order. That's Q U A L I A life.com/trig. Your body's built to repair itself. Qualia helps it to do that better. Big thanks to Qualia for sponsoring this episode. [snorts] For those who are interested in, you know, how how the government, you know, works here. It's just it's a mirror of what you get at the national level. You've got the executive branch run by the governor and you've got the legislature like Congress. And the legislature is churning out all this crap. >> I mean, we all the time. And they have a super majority, the Democrats. We have two/3s majority, which by the way is not legitimate. It's the product of gerrymandered maps. Let's not get into that. Whatever it exists, it's a that means they can pass anything they want without any kind of input from Republicans. And they're just passing a ton of I mean, apart from anything else, it's just the amount of it. Like I just did an event in Sacramento, the state capital, just highlighting the sheer amount of legislation. Like this year, this calendar year, the this the session, they passed 1,117 bills. We stacked them up. We printed them out just to see. I mean, I know I'm short. It was literally double my height. Okay. And every year more crap pushed by lobbyists and and all the special all that stuff. So you can't really do anything about that as governor. You can't just unwrite laws. But what you can do is deal with the bureaucratic aspect of that. The you run the government and there's a number of things. So let's just take the regulations. I'll give you a really couple of specific examples. So one of the things that's most insane about this this this current ideology and actually if you look at like what's causing the most damage if you had to single one thing out is the climate extremism. Actually, when you look at like the real driver of the cost of everything being so high, including housing, it's this climate I call it climate elitism because the people who are paying the price for it are workingclass Californians. And that a ton of that is not legislated specifically is the way it's implemented by these endless agencies. We've got 200 plus state agencies like carb, the California Air Resources Board that are just churning out these new rules on everything from trucks and you know they have this thing called VMT vehicle miles traveled. that gets in the way of building anything because if you want to build anything you have to do a calculation of vehicle how many vehicle miles traveled will be the result of you building a new housing development or what a a guy who runs a lovely just sweet exactly the kind of business I love right it was an artisan gin distiller in the central coast of California beautiful young entrepreneur you know he's lovely business he was telling me that he doing really well and he wanted to build a second still like whatever you know I anything else to write and they you had to go through all the crap and it was denied because of VMT vehicle miles travel because it would increase vehicle miles tra Yes that's called growth that's called progress like more development more and they don't want that but that stuff is coming out of the bureaucracy so what as governor you can do you appoint thousands of people to hundreds of these agencies another example is or is when in the same sort of area oil and gas. So we have abundant oil reserves in California. I mean you know not just kind of behind us in Kern County 70 miles or so and I mean not the not as big as some of the states but I think we have the fifth biggest in America. We could meet we we used to produce most of the oil and gas we use in California from within California because of their war on fossil fuels. the climate warriors are shutting it down. So we now are in a ludicrous situation. We're using about the same as we ever did, but instead of producing it in Kern County near Bakersfield and it coming on a nice clean pipeline to the refineries here in LA and up on the coast in the Bay Area, um we're now shipping it in on giant super tankers, the most polluting form of transportation on the planet. They run on bunker fuel, which is like the most dirty, spewing out carbon emissions. Our number one supplier of oil now used to be California, used to be from here is Iraq where they produce it in a terrible dirty way, terrible human rights record, but that's what we're now doing. Um, all of and also our gas prices, we have abundant oil reserves now higher, the highest in the country, higher than Hawaii in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. >> That's just insane, right? And again, I want to come back to the the, you know, the man of the people point, but yes, because the first pledge I made in the election campaign, I mean, I've been working on all this stuff for years, but as a candidate was $3 gas, which to some people around the I mean, may not mean much if you're not watching in California, but like we have it's $5 and it's heading up to six and seven cuz refineries are closing because of all of this. And that really hurts regular working people who are driving 2, three, 4 hours a day to get to and from work because in their cars and trucks, that's like $100 or so a a month that you save with $3 gas. How will I get that done? Actually, you put people into these agencies, the air resources board or to be very precise terms of oil and gas production, calm, geologic and energy management. And the way they're shutting down the California oil and gas industry is not um there's no legislation that did that. It's it's the bureaucrats in that agency who are refusing to issue permits to maintain existing wells, to expand them, to drill new wells in existing oil fields, all of that can change almost overnight. So I can't do everything. But if you if you understand how the government works and you really have a a detailed plan, a little bit like Trump this time around compared to the first Trump administration, this time they were really well prepared and they kind of knew what they wanted to do, the people they wanted to put in the executive orders, all of that. So that's so on not on everything, but on a lot of these things you can make a big difference. I'll just quickly do homelessness because you asked about that. So the thing about homelessness is that it's it's totally avoid. It should never have happened. is completely avoidable. And the way I always put it is we would never allow someone we love to live like that. So why do we tolerate this for people we don't know? And the fact about homelessness is that it's illegal. It's it's illegal to sleep on the streets. These homeless encampments are illegal. They've always been illegal. and all these cities and and and county government, you know, local government in California, they just sort of put up with it because there was a supreme there's a there's a court case, I don't know, years ago called the Boise ruling. They said, well, you can't move people off the streets unless you have adequate shelter available. They hid behind that and said, well, and defined shelter as per what they call permanent supportive housing, which is an apartment unit that costs like $700,000 or going higher. That's not what that meant at They could have put people off the streets, taken them off the streets, put them in shelter, got them into treatment, but the law says you can't require sobriety or abstinence from I mean 80 plus% of people who are homeless have drug or alcohol addiction or mental health problems. So, it's just this mess that they haven't dealt with. The state as governor, you have state law enforcement resources. You have a police force you can use. And so I I say very clearly if they won't enforce the law, I will and I'll provide shelter and treatment and get people into what there's so many great organizations. They're just ready to do that. But they've got this attitude, this mindset of what they call compassion, which is you can't force people to do something. And the result is this squalor and danger. and and parents, you know, they walk their kids to school and they're literally stepping over dead people who've oded from fentinel. I mean, this is just unbelievable. >> To me, one of the major issues that California lost its mind >> was crime. >> It effectively seemed to legalize crime. And I remember watching this going, >> \"This is completely not is it only bonkers, it's completely unsustainable. You've just the the the Democrat government effectively legalized shoplifting. I mean, if I'm >> Yes. >> talking out of my proverbial, please correct me. >> Okay. Do you want me to I'll get into it, but it's a it's a it's a terrible sorry story of >> it's what we do at trigonometry. >> I know. I'll get into it. So, okay. It actually goes back to something that I really can do something about as governor. So, it's worth really understanding the sort of detail here. So, it goes back to prison overcrowding. And there was a Supreme Court ruling, I don't know, this is like in the early 2010s, I can't remember exactly when, that said, California's jails, prisons, state prisons are overcrowded. It's inhumane. You got to do something about it. So, instead of doing what I think most sensible people say, right, well, let's build some more so we have room for the criminals that we need to put say, oh, no, let's let everyone out. And that's the way that you deal with it. So there was this whole process for a few years where the goal and it's a big part of what they call criminal justice reform was decarceration. Decarceration, taking people out of jail. And as a part of that, there was a whole combination of things. And the and the and the big one that related to um uh the point you make about shoplifting was a ballot initiative in 2014 called Proposition 47. And that was the one that famously is associated with Kla Harris because she was state attorney general. But to be accurate and fair, it wasn't her thing. It was a ballot initiative that was put together by, you know, leftist activists supported by the then Governor Jerry Brown. Very strongly supported. and she said she was neutral but actually as attorney general she wasn't at all. The way the language was written on the ballot initiative was basically selling. It was literally called something insane like not the name of it but the description and then all the marketing was the safe neighborhoods and schools act. And that's where you got this thing which is up to $950 a day you could steal per day and it would just be a misdemeanor like a parking ticket basically not a felony. So no jail time. The goal was to stop people going to prison. That was the purpose of all of that. And then behind that was not just the original impetus, which was the Supreme Court ruling on overcrowding, but also the phil the ideology, which is prison is bad because it's racist. So it goes back to the race woke thing because and you hear people talk like that today still, right? That we should shut all the prisons because it's racist. Why? because um there there are disproportionate numbers of black people in prison in jail um and especially young black men and as a as the woke ideology states any racial disparity is always the product of racism. Hence the prisons are racist so we have to shut the prisons. So you've had this, but that's the first thing that happened which was Prop 47 and that had the legalized shoplifting effectively and a bunch of other stuff as well, but that was the main one. And of course, what does that do? All the people that need to steal to feel their fuel their drug habit and then you get this massive explosion of retail theft and car breakins and car all of that stuff just exploded and there's nothing you could do because they said you all you get is a you know just a sort of nothing of a sentence. It's it's basically legalized. And and there were a whole bunch of other things. There's another one in a way even more absurdly egregious which was less discussed which is proposition Prop 57 which is 2 years later. And this one Kla Harris I would argue is more directly responsible for. And that one again driven by the desire to push this decarceration agenda downgraded a whole bunch of other crimes so that they wouldn't get automatic prison time. And they claimed it was only it was nonviolent offenses. They weren't touching violent offenses. But there's if you look at the list of crimes that they downgraded that could no longer qualify for automatic prison time. Literally one of them is domestic violence. Like it's in the name of the thing, but they said it was nonviolence. So domestic violence, the rape of an unconscious woman now downgraded. Trafficking a child for sex, a whole bunch of child sex crimes. Okay, so that's what happened. And it's just gone on and on and it was driven by this ideology of we can't have anyone in jail cuz jails are racist. >> So when they said the rape of an unconscious woman, do they mean that so effectively somebody who puts some a drug in a woman's drink? Yes. >> She becomes unconscious. He then goes on and rapes her. That's not a jail sentence. >> Correct. Not automatic. >> Correct. >> I know. I know. And this claim Harris pushed this as state attorney general. that she's more responsible for that than I mean in in the whole sort of national conversation and actually that first one I mentioned the $950 a day that was mostly reversed last year in an initiative that was passed called propos I'm sorry about all these numbers Prop 36 that kind of reversed most of that but the other stuff in Prop 57 they're downgrading all these unspeakable crimes that they wouldn't you could still get a jail sentence, but not automatic was the Republicans in the state legislature have been battling for years, literally for years, to pick them off one by one to try and reinstate them as and the definition is serious and violent offense. It's a definition in the legal thing that means that if it's if it's in that category, if it's called a serious and violent crime, it automat gets jail time. And you've literally if you follow what's goes on the state legislature the last two or three years friends of mine in the state legislature woman called Shannon Grove particularly has been strong on this has been you know year by year trying to get um child sex trafficking upgraded to a serious and violent crime and it was blocked by the Democrats time after time. She one year it completely failed. She had to come back the next year. It's insane. It is >> and and and it only in the end and and again it happened and there's about two or three of these examples and and and I can't remember the exact details but varants of unspeakable disgust the worst crimes involving children and sex with a minor you know selling a se a child for sex and they battled to actually turn you know give them the appropriate sentence and it was only finally that Gavin Newsome the government was so embarrassed he's running for president. I mean just this year had to step in. They voted it down. She was telling Sharon was telling me stories about she would have victims victims in the to the committees in the state legislature to give evidence. victims of child sex trafficking and they wouldn't let them speak because they didn't want to hear it because they're so and I think it re actually I'm really glad we got into this because to me probably more than anything else it just really captures the extent to which ideology has just taken over. ideology over all else. And it's this ideology of decarceration, criminal justice reform, prison is bad, can't send anyone to jail at all for anything. >> It It's crazy. And one of the other things I wanted to ask you about is you mentioned President Trump. Obviously, in his second term, he is having a real go at dealing with illegal immigration. >> Yeah. >> And the bulk of that seems perfectly normal and reasonable and good and right. But there are some excesses and people are pointing out and there of course protest here in LA. >> Yeah. >> Where do you come down on on the way that the border and deportations and illegal immigrations are being handled? >> Well, let's just talk about the the issue for for a start. I mean, you've got I mean, I hear this the sto this story the whole time and I want to put a few things together. Um, going back to what I was saying earlier, highest unemployment rate, highest poverty rate, all of this. So you've got there's a story that is told which is we need illegal immigration because we have a labor shortage and who's going to do these jobs and that's particularly strong in California some of the industries that you know like agriculture and construction and all of this well I mean I all the time I come across story I was at the sac the the California state fair in Sacramento went up to a couple as I do just saying hi I'm Steve got into a conversation and it was a family. It was the mother and a couple with their three children. And they just we just started chatting and I said, \"What do you do?\" He said, \"Well, I work construction.\" \"Oh, I used to work construction.\" \"Why? Why do you say?\" Well, I can't get a job anymore. Why not? Well, they don't want to employ people like me. What do you And he didn't want to say it. And I said, \"What do you mean?\" He said, \"Local people.\" And what he meant by that and we got into it was and the mother chimed in as well. And how I can't get a job. was now living with his mother, humiliated, right? He's a he's a man trying to provide for his family. He's now ended up living with his mother who's and the point they made was because it's they they want to hire illegal immigrants because it's cheaper. They don't have to pay um the right level. And then a really big one which isn't talked about enough, they don't and the mother chimed in with this. There's a video, by the way. I'm not You can watch the video. People can Google it on X, Steve Hilton State Fair. You'll see the conversation. Um and the mother said health and health care they won't pay they don't need to pay health care for illegal immigrants which is a big cost for an employer >> and then at that moment you just see it all come together because you've got employers who are it's basically a subsidy to employers this whole thing this it's a scam because while all that is going on and Gavin Newsome has been first introduced it and has increased it guess who does pay the healthcare for illegal immigrants the taxpayer cuz like he's giving free healthcare to illegal immigrants. >> Other states don't do that and it's a big amount of money. It's like this budget year he just increased it from I think 9.4 billion to 12.1 12 billion just for illegal immigrant healthcare just for that. And so the whole system is broken because and and then another thing you and you look at the the welfare payments as well and this this this idea that we don't have enough workers and we have to import the workers and that's why it's ridiculous because part of the argument about the about the immigration enforcement okay you get the high-profile incidents but there's a there's this thing people said well you're going to kick who's going to do the jobs if you if you do this well I was at a dairy in uh Hillar in um up the top part of the central valley. It was the biggest cheese factory in the world. So, one of the things I love about California, everywhere you go, it's like the biggest this in the world or the most what biggest cheese factory in the world. And I was talking to some of the guys who work on the dairy and they don't make a ton of money. They make like 4550 grand. And they were saying work full-time in the dairy. And they were saying their girlfriends make more money from welfare. So, you've got this crazy system going on where people don't work. Then you have people who do want to work who can't because of the legal immigration. So it's a mess. And and and the people who are losing out on from this all this are regular workingclass people. >> And by the way, this argument isn't true. Like in a market economy, you this is some something Eric Weinstein mentioned when we had in a private conversation we had is an obvious fact. in a market economy other than some very niche areas, you can't have labor shortages that you have to fill with illegal immigration because all you have to do is raise the price to a normal wage and the nor local people quote unquote >> and also reduce the ability to live on I mean here's another one I mean they I can't keep track of it all in near it was someone who runs a hotel owns a hotel just one I think maybe two near Sacramento he'd hired someone from Afghanistan um who was um actually brought in by the US government and the whole story was amazing. I mean he was this Afghan guy was he hired him to drive the shuttle bus to take guests to and from is an airport hotel and and he said the guy from Afghanistan was um telling him about his experience. He'd been flown from Afghanistan by the US government first to Virginia, then moved to Sacramento, given a house. Um they stocked his fridge. The guy he couldn't didn't know which bit of the government. And it was uh and the guy was told we we're going to um send you groceries by delivery because you shouldn't go to the grocery store because Americans are racist and you shouldn't go. Like imagine that, the government saying that. Anyway, he's then he's there. He's working as the shuttle driver. He says to the guy, \"After 2 days, can I go uh can you pay me cash?\" And he said, \"Why do you want to do that?\" I said, \"Well, if I if I'm on payroll, then I lose my benefits, my welfare benefits.\" How what do you how much is that? $7,000 a month. >> What? 84 grand a year? >> Yes. 7 That's what he said. >> So, like when you So, it's just [ __ ] This whole the whole thing is [ __ ] >> So, it needs fixing. But my question to you was about the way it is being. Okay. So, first of all, the you can't have this conversation without just pointing out the extraordinary success of the border thing like closing the border. It's just an incredible example of when people say government doesn't work and government like incredible government action that it just basically stopped. You know, this flow of illegal immigration basically stopped to zero just with firm action that everyone said couldn't be done for decades and is just done just because there's someone who's really committed to doing it and has a team that was wellprepared and did it. So that's the that's good news. Then you got the problem of millions of people here and no one has an idea how many um who are here illegally and of the the whole argument is from the administration which is the the worst go first right we target criminals who are of course every illegal immigrant is a criminal in one sense because they've broken the law by being here illegally but on top of that another crime and Tom Hman who's runs the borders friend of mine I've known him for years and And he points he makes this argument which is that the reason that we have these kind of tough confrontations and the kind of pictures and the video that you that that cause people to be upset and sometimes have provoked protests and violent clashes whatever is entirely because we don't get cooperation from the local local and state government where we're trying to find people and and that is and here in California it's called it's a sanctuary It was a law that was passed in 2017, SB54, that said you can't cooperate with federal law, federal immigration enforcement. So literally, you have someone in jail for some or in the in custody in some sense in the system in California who's an illegal immigrant and has committed a violent crime or any kind of crime and they actively refuse to tell that person to to tell ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, that that person's there. So they could just night, you know, hand them over and say, \"Here's this person.\" So that means that they have to go into the community to find them where they're hiding out after they've been released or whatever. And that is what causes both the confrontation but also um noncriminal illegal immigrants to be swept up in the whole process. So their argument is if we had proper cooperation, we wouldn't need any of this. That's the argument. I mean, look, I don't know. I mean, I actually, it's a federal issue. It's federal immigration. So, it's not something that I spend too much time on other than to say as governor, I would I think it's important to cooperate. It's federal. It's the f it's the law. Congress passed the law. They're just enforcing the law. I think there's, you know, this this idea that we can just pick and choose just on a mass scale. Well, we're just not not going to we're just going to ignore that. >> I guess the counterargument might be I mean, we had Sam Harris on the show recently and he talked about this in very different terms to you in terms of ICE agent not identifying themselves grabbing some guy off the street uh you know getting physical all of this stuff. Um and then he also talked about the fact that there are people whose kids are American citizens for example these people are being >> and look I think it's a >> voters will have different views on that. I'm just curious to know what your views are. >> But how many >> a small number I imagine >> like I don't know five six national it's a tiny number. >> Yeah. >> I mean nationally I think the total number of American citizens or permanent residents that have been according to the data is about 170. It's a country of like 300 million or whatever, you know, like this is and and so again that could even that tiny number could be avoided if you had proper cooperation >> and the people you're talking about are criminal, you know, I mean just look at the the the crimes that they've committed. These these are sex offenders. This is what's amazing to me. You have people on the left who are now literally taking the side of rapists and wife like that that famous guy, what's his name? Garcia Diego, whatever. He became a sort of, you know, national case. I can't remember the name. is a wife beater. Domestic violence and he's the hero. You have you Democrat US senators flying down to wherever it was to sort of hang out with him because they're on the side of the domestic violence perpetrators. It's just incredible. Why? Cuz they want to stick it to Trump. >> How does that make I mean that's what's ridiculous about this. And it could all be avoided if they were if if we just had a bit of common sense and cooperation. and they they just don't want to do that. And even within the sanctuary state law in California, they keep saying you have these, you know, local leadership and uh sheriffs and whatever saying we can't cooperate because it's the law. Even with I've read the law, even within the law that was passed in California, there's a long list of crimes where if if the illegal immigrant is involved in one of these mo over 200 ranging from, you know, what you'd expect an incredibly serious murder and whatever to actually, you know, um uh drug possession, illegal firearm possession that that the the word is discretion. There's discretion to cooperate. If only they did that, so much of this could be avoided. You wouldn't need to do it that way. And you talk about the masks. Why do they wear masks? Because of the doxing. These are people with families. Like they're literally they've been aggressive. You have very well financed what you know illegal immigration groups that are actively targeting law enforcement who are just doing the job that they're enforcing the law that Congress passed and they're being doxed so that they're and you have many stories of their families being threatened and so that's why they wear masks. Steve, >> by the way, these people who are now passing laws as they did in California, it is a little bit of an irony that, you know, after forcing us pointlessly to wear masks for all these years, they literally now pass law saying you banning maskearing. >> Well, I mean, nobody expects that side of the political spectrum to be entirely logical. >> At the start of a new year, everyone talks about resolutions, but most people try to brute force change with willpower alone and burn out by February. But have you ever thought about hypnosis as a solution? Hypnosis gets a bad rap, but it's not a gimmick. It's a legitimate therapeutic tool backed by research. And when it comes to weight loss, it can be a gamecher. Hypnotio is a self-hypnotherapy app that helps you break bad eating patterns by working at the subconscious level where the real habits live. It's for people who are done with willpower only plans. Hypnosio helps you tackle emotional eating, stress related cravings, and food anxiety using proven techniques that reduce cortisol, improve portion control, and build long-term habits. All in a way that fits into real life from your phone, tablet, or your computer. Clinical studies show that users lost twice as much weight as those using traditional diets alone, and 94% maintain that weight loss more effectively over time. It's not about hacks, it's about fixing the deeper programming. Hypnosis-based programs reduce BMI and emotional eating significantly compared to standard diets. So, what are you waiting for?

But more importantly, it seems that you're going to have to spend a lot of money, aren't you, in order to correct some of the problems that this state is facing. If you think about I look at the number of mentally ill people >> on the streets of this city there is no way in any shape or form they should be on the streets and you can say they've got drug addictions and I'm sure many of them do but they also profoundly mentally ill. We're talking schizophrenia here or other types. So they're they're going to need to be housed somewhere and many of them they can't afford to pay. So it's the state that's going to have to pay. You're looking at, you've already spoken about the fact that penitentiies were full to overflowing. We're going to need to build more prisons here. >> That's part of my plan. Exactly. >> So, so let's talk about that because that's also going to cost money if we're going to be honest. >> Yeah. But look at what they're spending money on. I mean, okay, they've doubled the budget of California in the last 10 years. It's gone from 160 billion to just over 320 billion. Okay. Where's that money going? Let's just narrowly look at >> um the homeless issue. So, this is and and the mental health costs associated with that. So their solution, and I touched on it earlier, there has this there's this thing they call permanent supportive housing. So they build apartment units for homeless people because it's the government. They layer on everything that you'd expect. So it's just unbelievable when you actually dig into it how it's like Britain in the 1970s. The unions run this state. So you have massive, you know, crony deals with the unions. So these apartment units I mentioned $700,000 earlier in the Bay in the San Francisco Bay area now they're costing a million dollars each in LA. You know the inc to build that money is from the same pot, right? I've got a friend who builds apartments using this new technology mass timber where you can you put timber. It's a really amazing new building material and you it's very innovative and it's whatever building apartments without without all the [ __ ] regulations. It's a quarter of the price. It costs four or five times as much to build anything in California as in neighboring states. So that's so that's all all the the that's where the budget's going. So you look at the money, there was an audit done not that long ago, $24 billion on homelessness with no discernable impact. The problem just got worse. So the money is it's not like we need to spend more. I'm We need to cut the budget of California, not spend more money. So, so there's two things I want to do is like reduce the budget because we got to cut taxes. That's that's the other. We have the highest taxes in the country for the worst outcomes. We got to cut taxes for a start and then we've got to spend the money where it needs to be specifically on mental health. Let's look at that. So, exactly as you say, look a lot of the people are low income. So when you talk about mental health care, it's part of the health care system and for low-inccome people that means it's Medicaid which is medical in California and that is federally reimbured. It's a very connected to the federal healthare system. Most of the money spent on that in California is actually federal money. And there's a massive scam that I don't even want to get into where it's classic California. They've got this medical provider tax that they've brought in which increases the cost of everything in order that they can attract matching funds from the federal government. It's just unbelievable. And of course, they're donors of the medical the healthcare industry who benefit from taxes go up. Nothing gets better. But one thing that's amazing about Medicaid and mental health is that when the system was set up in the 60s, they put in place this thing called the IMD rule, institutions of mental disease. And it's all based on that attitude of we can't have these big mental asylums. It's inhumane. One flow of the cuckoo's nest. All of that stuff. So there's a limit that was put in. If you to get Medicaid reimbursement from the federal government, you can't get it if your mental health institution has more than 16 beds. It's a very specific limit. 16 bed limit, which is insane. Imagine if hospitals had a 16 bed limit. How inefficient that would be. That's what we have for mental health for reimbursement from Medicaid. So the first Trump administration put in place a waiver so states could apply for a waiver so they they could ignore that limit. Cal other states have taken it up. California hasn't. So just there's all these things you can do to make things work. Just there's no the people in charge are clueless idiots who are just machine politicians who don't understand how anything works. They've no clue how to make anything happen. So within that massive budget, so I don't accept for a second that you need to spend more money. We need to spend less money and then what what's left after the reduction in spending so that we can cut taxes. You got to spend it better in sensible ways where you actually, you know, put condition, you know, outcomes based on what you're spending so you get results for it. You're not just putting into this corrupt pot. Well, it's there's so much corruption around this. I mean I mentioned the unions >> the there's this whole scam which is the unions filing lawsuits that's the other massive problem in California not just over regulation over litigation there's something called secret the California environmental quality act it's >> was in the 19 1970s Ronald Reagan when he was governor signed it was supposed to you know stop polluting factories whatever nice environmental protection we love it >> over the years it's been expanded to cover everything the courts expanded not the legislature, including housing 70% and then and then they granted this thing called the private right of action. Anyone can file a lawsuit. It's a bit like that private attorney general thing where you can just you get all these nuisance lawsuits. 70% of lawsuits under secret are filed to block housing. Most of those lawsuits are filed by the unions. The unions use them as leverage to to get what they call project labor agreements where they get deals from and they they negotiate. The two components of a project labor agreement are what they call skilled and trained workers and prevailing wage. Both of which sound very innocuous. Skilled and trained is a euphemism for union members only. It's the closed shop which we banned in England with Mr. Thatcher back in the 80s that still exists in California. It's amazing. and prevailing wage and of course it's much more expensive. I was talking to someone trying to in the central valley they're doing a housing development they carpet fitters you put the carpets in you need to have union labor mandatory there weren't any union carpet fitters in anywhere nearby they had to bust them in from San Francisco put them up in hotel I mean just mad right prevailing wage sounds very nice um this guy was telling me that he had a team of plumbers doing a job that was market rate uh $25 to $40 an hour. The same people on a prevailing wage job the other side of town $95 to $120 an hour and for the same work which actually by the way they take they spend three times as long doing the prevailing wage things. They get more money. So there's just incredible amounts of cost inflation built into the system because for years no one's taken a look at it and it just goes on. They pass these laws, the unions run everything. So to your point about when you say you have to increase spending, no, you have to get into all this like it should it's you know these we're spending money on apartment buildings that are four times what they should cost. Public money. So there's plenty of money there. >> And also but it's going to cost a lot more to build penitentiaries, Steve, to build and staff penitentiies. That's going to cost a lot more. Well, they've shut F four and there's a fifth that's about to close, Gavin. You so I' I've pledged to reverse that. You need to increase prison capacity. Um, but again, you don't tell me you can't find money in the budget for that for savings. I mean, the amount of bloat is just astronomical. And also by the way you can do I mean this is what one of the things I tried to work on back in the day in when I was in the UK government is payment by results where you actually put contracts in place where you don't just got hand out money you get paid in exchange for results and so for the prisons what you want the actual goal of it of course there's an accountability aspect you got to punish people hold them accountable for their crimes but you've also got to rehabilitate them because like what nearly half of the crime is reoffending so you want to reduce that and that's how you reduce crime and that reduces cost. So you can put there's all sorts of things you could if you had common sense practical people. I just want to tell a story if I might about the the kind of [ __ ] that's been going on in California and it's to do with the fires here in LA and it's a it's a little story but I think it tells so much about the kind of people you've had in charge. It's Karen Bass, the mayor of LA. And a few months into the, you know, recovery from the wildfires this year, and there's all this, you know, focus on permits and rebuilding and why isn't anything happening, and it's all so slow. And she and she, I saw a post on social media, and it from Karen, Mayor Karen Bass. It said, \"I have just signed an executive order streamlining permitting for rebuilding in LA.\" Great. Well, it's 4 months too late, but whatever. I'll take it. And then it was above a clip from the press conference, a video clip. So I thought, okay, I'll watch what she actually said. So what she actually said was I remember it very precisely. I have just signed an executive order tasking agency heads with developing paths forward to streamlining permitting. And to me, that captures it all. These are [ __ ] people. They're process people. They don't know how to make anything work. They just spend money, spend money, nothing happens. And that's why you have this total mess on every front. >> Steve, last time we had you on, one of the things we explored is you mentioned your time in the UK government and you talked about the challenges any leader of Britain has getting any of their policies implemented because of what we in Britain call the civil service. >> I imagine the institutional resistance to a guy like you in this state is going to make that pale in in comparison. So you're going to have the entire institutionalized bureaucracy >> 100% >> sticking sticks in the wheels of your >> and lawsuits. I mean that's what I'm really >> So how are you going to deal with that? >> You got to be prepared. I mean I'm doing the work right now. I'm going through it. You know I've got a strong you know it's like running a campaign like this. It's a startup. You know we're trying to raise money. There's no it's not you don't inherit any kind of party resources or infrastructure anything like that. So it's not like we have unlimited far from it hardly any resources. It's very much a shoestring operation, but I've got really good volunteers. I've got someone, you know, like great, you know, legal people work because I think the lawsuits are going to be a big part of it. And you got to be be really clear about how you how you make things happen. And you just got to be really well prepared. You've got to have on day one think through how they're going to oppose it. But there's no substitute for just cutting their number. I mean, that, you know, that's where that's the conclusion I came to in the UK. There's just too many of them. and and so that's where all the you know bloat is coming from and you just got to you know reduce it massively. I mean here's an example. You just saw Gavin Newsome in the budget this year where we had a deficit in California. So all this spending and there's still a deficit um a deficit of 12 billion in the budget. You can't states can't have a deficit. It has to be you have to balance the books. And so five billion they did with accounting tricks um shuffling money to future years or whatever. And then seven billion he took from the rainy day fund which is supposed to be like a savings thing for something going badly wrong or when you're in recession. $7 billion in the same budget that he was stealing from the savings that are supposed to be for something completely different. He increased spending on the bureaucracy in California by the same and by seven it's exactly the same number seven billion dollars increasing the number of bureaucrats and increasing their pay and pensions and all this why corruption because he's running >> vote for him >> and the union the government unions he wants their endorsement and their money when he runs for president >> right >> and so you just got to I mean you just got to be direct about it and and take it on Well, speaking of Gavin Newsome, you mentioned him a number of times. He looks great. >> Great hair. >> Great hair. >> Well, I I as I say, >> no offense, mate. [laughter] >> I say it's time for a government with less hair. >> That is what we need in We've had enough of the hair. >> But Gavin Newsome, I mean, he strikes me I don't agree with a lot of the things he says. He strikes me as a very capable politician. What does America get if it has a President Nuome? the the I mean [laughter] the worst governor in America like a total failure on every front. I mean everything is a disaster and so his record I think is going to be totally disqualifying. He's got nothing to point to nothing. I just think that the more that that comes out um and the more details of that that come out I don't think he's got a chance because people will just look at that and say you know that I mean you remember that years ago that that classic ad on Michael Dukakus about don't let Michael he ran in 1988 he was governor of Massachusetts and there was very effective ad with just some you know filth and pollution in Boston Harbor or something I can't remember and and it was just don't let Michael Dukes do to America what he's done to mass Massachusetts. It was a killer. And I think there's just a lot of material from California. I agree with you. He's he's he's good at the politics and but that but that only takes you so far. You've got an actual record and it's a total disaster. And and I just think that um he's he's he's been able to escape because he hasn't had real challenge to that. you know, he hasn't really been taken on in a debate or, you know, I mean, he's had a couple of debates, but not really with anyone who can really get into the record and and expose the complete calamitous failure. So, I think that um uh you know, Hill is obviously running, he's been running for 20 years, people say it's all he's really been focused on, but I think it's just the scale of the failure. It's not just middling. We're literally like the the line I use all the time is we're top of every list you want to be the bottom of and bottom of every list you want to be the top of. It's a total failure. And he's and so I don't know. I can't I can't see it. I just can't see the country voting for, you know, looking at what's happened in California. Yes, please. We'll have more of that. >> Well, Steve, uh if you are successful in the election next year, you will it will be a political earthquake. I mean, there's no understating that. a Republican getting elected as governor of California would be quite incredible. So, so one of the reasons we were interested in having you on this early just to watch the journey and see how that unfolds. Uh that would be fascinating. We're going to ask you some questions from our supporters. A lot of them are residents here in California in a second. Before we do though, what's the one thing we're not talking about that we really should be? >> I want to say something about how amazing it is, how amazing this country is. Actually, >> you've been here too long, mate. >> No, no, no. I I understand, [laughter] but I can sort of, you know, show up here and, you know, be in this position. >> Yeah, I was thinking about that. >> It's actually amazing and and it's beautiful. >> You're a first generation American running for governor of >> California. We moved here in 2012 with my wife and my two sons and I taught at Stanford University and I started a business and hosted a show on TV and now I'm running for government leading in the polls. It's amazing, you know, and I love this country and I'm, you know, I became an American 2021 and actually I I I've taken a step further. I've renounced my UK citizenship. Um, which I didn't realize this is a bureaucratic process you go through. You also have to pay I didn't realize that. I've just paid the exit fee, which is £482. So, I'm all in for California and America. >> Steve Hilton, thank you very much for being here. Head on over to Substack where Steve is going to answer your questions. >> [music] >> What are California's greatest resources and how can executive policy immediately impact the employment of them without waiting on the legislature. [music] [music]"

If you borrow to consume, well, that way lies [music] trouble. And that's what we've been doing. You're finally going to be forced, whether [music] you're China, Europe, the UK, the United States, to do something radical. [music] And this is where Mr. Mle is interesting. Are we headed in a sort of 1920s direction, [music] 1930s direction? >> The ideologies are the same old same old. It's sort of depressing that we can't come up with new material, but here we [laughter] are again. >> Those who enter adulthood without a clue about how interest [music] rates work, who don't know what a bond yield is, who've never made an investment in the stock market and never will, those people will have worse lives than the people who get informed. you will be poor. >> Sil Ferguson, welcome back to Trigonometry. >> Good to be back. >> You are one of course one of our favorite historians to have on the show. Um, and the thing that we want to talk to you about today is money. uh one of the things you have been prominent in trying to raise attention for and awareness of is the level of indebtedness the western world is in particularly as it relates to our military spending because there's some historical patterns that are very unfavorable on that um side of things. We'll get into that. But we thought you being one of the world's most interesting and prominent historians, the first thing we should talk about is something you wrote about immediately after the financial crisis uh in your book called the scent of money uh which is money, debt, finance. And the best place to start I think is right at the very beginning which is what is money and where does it come from? >> Well, it's great to be back. [laughter] When you said we want to talk about money, I thought I don't owe them anything. In fact, I had the involuntary Scottish reaction. I nearly touched my wallet just to make sure it was there. Uh money is uh a very ancient thing. Uh it's the way in which uh human beings transact that is superior to barter. And so we find uh thousands of years ago, you know, 2,000 years before Christ, that IUS are being carved in little pieces of clay in ancient Mesopotamia. And that's really the origins of money because if uh I owe you two uh silver rings, uh it's much more convenient to just write that down than for me to say, I think that's roughly three sheep or maybe two and a half goats. So money is just a way of making exchange much smoother than if you tried to do it by barter. I mean, if you've ever tried barter, you'll realize immediately that the difficulty uh that that sheep and and and so forth are not that fungeible. So, that's the key concept behind money. And almost anything can serve as money. When you say money, these days, uh there are still people who think that it's pieces of paper or or cloth, banknotes. Those have largely gone extinct in England as far as I can see. But Americans still tend to think of money as as dollar bills. Uh older people will remember coins uh round metal objects. And so that was money for quite a few centuries, but uh that's relatively recent by historic standards. The first money is, as I said, clay tablets with little uh inscriptions on them. Uh shells have been used as money. Large rather inconveniently large stones have been used as money. pretty much anything can be used as money. Steven Colbear once asked me on the Colbear report, uh, am I money? And I said, \"Yes, if you know, if you want to be, if you want to be a medium of exchange, then you can be money.\" M and uh I imagine that there is a bit of a transition between bart and money in the sense that an IOU carved in a tablet it implies a level of social trust or some sort of cultural adaptation and innovation to facilitate is that a fair assumption it it it's important for money to work that it should be trusted and in fact uh I think I once wrote in the ascent of money that it's it's trust in script described u particularly if it's a piece of of clay I mean its intrinsic worth is almost zero but if it says that it's exchangeable for two silver rings or three sheep then you kind of have to believe that a counterparty will agree that that's the case. So there's an element of of trust and that is why we don't really encounter money in in prehistoric societies. Uh it's something that that really is associated with the beginnings of of civilization. Of course, today most money is invisible. It it really exists in electronic ledgers uh of banks and that's that's most money today. Relatively small amounts of money consist of banknotes and coins, tiny in some uh cases. And so most money is in fact invisible electronic items in bank accounts. And in fact, most money is created by banks uh when when they uh credit uh somebody with an amount of money. Uh we all have to trust banks for a system based on fractional reserve banking to work. Uh you mentioned that the ascent of money was written after the financial crisis. That's incorrect. It was written before the financial crisis and published just before the uh failure of Lehman Brothers which tells you that I anticipated the financial crisis which I did because the book was begun in 2006 at a point when very few people realized a huge financial crisis was coming. Uh but that was my motivation for writing it. I was very confident that a large financial crisis was coming and at the heart of that crisis was a loss of trust in banks. uh you're so young, you may not remember the lines outside Northern Rock. There were genuine bank runs uh in Britain and the United States. And so at the heart of modern money uh is is the role of banks. If you lose trust in banks uh then you're in a financial crisis. >> And there's always been a connection between money and precious metals, particularly gold and silver. Why is that? I'm not sure if always is right. Uh periodically uh there has been gold is something that has been prized by human beings since time immemorial for the obvious reason that it looks nice and it's extremely durable and it's scarce. I mean these things are quite a combination. So we've we valued gold and most civilizations have have valued gold but not always as money. And so gold was valued by say uh Inca civilization in in South America but wasn't used as money. The interesting thing that happened in the course of history was uh that people began to use uh amounts fixed amounts of gold and fixed amounts of silver for payments. Uh and the sort of classic gold and silver coins are precisely that. But the problem is that that because gold is very rare and silver is relatively rare. >> Uh you can only really use gold and silver coins for quite big transactions. >> Uh and so you have the problem of well what do we do for small change uh and and hence the need to use base metals to produce coins for uh for smaller scale transactions. uh but the the link that you mentioned becomes hugely important in the course of the late 17th, 18th and 19th centuries when it is design decided beginning in this country England to create a fixed relationship [snorts] between money and and gold comes to be called the gold standard. And so uh pounds are defined in terms of a a quantity of of gold. This is one of Isaac Newton's many contributions uh to our civilization. Uh at the same time there were other systems that uh that defined uh money in terms of a quantity of silver and systems which did both by metallic systems. So for much of modern history, the kind of history that tends to get taught in schools in the 18th and 19th century, say at the time of the American Revolution, the French Revolution going right through the 19th century, the time of uh Britain's rise to imperial dominance, uh we are in a world where there are fixed uh legal relationships between money and precious metal. And so you can go to the Bank of England and say I got this uh this bank note that says uh 100 on it. I'd like the uh requisite amount of gold. So that that was the kind of system that that for a period of centuries came became very dominant persisted through into the early 20th century. It was suspended during wartime for reasons we can get into. Uh and it finally entirely broke down after uh World War II. It had a kind of afterlife as the Bretonwood system when only the dollar had a relationship to gold. And then in 1971, Richard Nixon severed that final link. And since 1971, there's been no link between precious metal and money except that central banks like to keep in their reserves some quantity of gold. And before we get into that because I think that's very important to the conversation that we are having. I would like to delve into a very interesting story you told in the book which is a man called I think it's Francisco Pizarro and his journey from Spain to South America and creating a form of currency. So the dream if you were in medieval Europe was if only we could find some more gold because there just wasn't that much. And indeed part of the problem for medieval economies is just there doesn't seem to be that much gold or silver in these relatively underdeveloped agricultural economies. That produces some interesting innovations. Um one of them is the bill of exchange uh which is another form of IOU only this time on paper uh where merchant A says I'll pay you merchant B X amount in in 3 months time and these IUs bills of exchange were tremendously important particularly in the period after the black death when there's a serious labor shortage uh in in Europe and there's also a chronic shortage of of precious metals. So, what do you do in a world where there isn't enough gold? Go and find some, obviously, and it's pretty clear that there isn't much in uh say England, not famous for its gold mines. And so, a lot of exploration, a lot of what sends uh men in ships around the world uh across the Atlantic or around the Cape of Good Hope in the other direction is the search for gold. And interestingly enough, uh the Spaniards uh strike uh it rich in Central and in South America. uh they find substantial deposits of precious metal in what today's uh Bolivia, Peru, Mexico [snorts] and that is enormously good news for the Spanish or Castellian Empire which acquires not only the territory and the people living there as a result of the concistador's success but also it accesses all the mineral rights. I mean there there there is literally a giant mountain of solid silver pottosi which I remember visiting when we filmed the television series of a sense of money. There is a television version by the way for those who've lost the power of reading books. You can find it all. It was all stolen by YouTube. Uh the intellectual property brazingly uh nicked. Um so the series of percent ascent money shows you the silver mountain the great mountain great mine of pottoy which is one of the principal sources for bullion for gold and silver and those were then sent from Spain's empire in the Americas uh all around the world principally to pay for the incessant wars that the Spanish kings fought uh in Europe and and elsewhere. I think this is taking us partly towards the modern conversation we want to have, but I also think it's an important conversation to have from a historical perspective as well, which is the leap from I owe you for this thing that you've given me to I owe you because you've given me money that I then have to repay you at a higher level. That is an extraordinary cultural adaptation that I imagine. First of all, it would be interesting to know when that happens and how that happens. But also, I imagine that is transformative for human society because it among other things allows you to effectively do things now that otherwise you'd have to wait 20 years to do. >> That's right. In in the end uh the most important uh development is to have uh institutions that can smooth uh all the different transactions that people want to make. uh and and these come to be called banks and we can see the first modern banks emerging in Renaissance Italy in Florence. The Medi start out as essentially foreign exchange dealers where you can bring in your coins that you picked up uh trading in Germany and exchange them for coins that are more likely to be acceptable in in Rome and they sat on benches banky and that's where the word bank >> comes from. So what do banks do? Well, well, banks create a kind of centralized uh exchange uh where people with money can deposit it uh and people who need money can borrow it. Again, to put it really simply. Uh and this clearly greases uh the wheels of commerce. It's part of the reason why you see a significant uptick in economic development in northern Italy at the time of the Renaissance. There is a more advanced financial system there. At the same time you can see in in London the merchants of London start to move uh beyond there being goldsmiths uh to there being banks. Bankers who can lend money to kings are really the progenitors of the modern city of London. Kings matter because and also republics but kings mostly matter because they they always have greater financial needs than they can uh they can satisfy with uh taxes on their subjects. And so one of the early sources of of debt finance is just the need that monarchs have. King of Spain needs money because he's fighting wars against the Dutch who decide to revolt against Spanish rule. That's part of the attraction of having silver and gold mines in the new world. you can finance the wars that way. So what we see happening in early modern Europe is the emergence of the modern financial institutions we know today, banks and systems of public debt where governments can borrow from their subjects or in the case of the Venetian Republic from citizens uh in order to finance those big expenditures like wars that you can't really finance out of current tax revenues because they're way more expensive than the annual tax revenues can can afford. Those are two big uh leaps forward in in the financial system. And so by the time you get to, let's say, 1700, uh you've already got certain key components of modern finance. You've got the concept of money as being coinage, but also potentially notes. uh you've got banks uh which allow borrowers and lenders to to transact through some kind of central uh institution and you've got the beginnings of a bond market. I I'll pause to explain bonds. Uh quite important thing to understand. Um so uh in a a bond a government will say uh you're going to lend me the government 100 fill in the currency blank and um and each year I'll pay you five uh of uh of that currency 5% of and that and I'll keep doing that for a fixed amount of time. It might be uh 10 years it might be a 100red years. It might be in perpetuity. Uh and these bonds are the basis of of of government debt management and they originate in in Italy uh in in Venice and and then all the different Italian city states develop that system of public finance.

Thanks to Wild Alaskan Company for sponsoring this episode. And Neil, what is it about Renaissance era, Northern Europe, Italy in particular, there was no such thing as Italy, but you know, the the the Italian states that existed at the time that allows them to do this because money lenders, I mean, money lenders are mentioned in the Bible, right? So, so the idea of borrowing money has, I imagine, existed for thousands of years by the point this happens. What is it that happens that that adaptation into banks actually takes place? >> Well, it complicates matters. uh that that Christianity uh and indeed Islam uh both take a rather dim view of lending money at interest. Uh there are even laws against it and the crime is defined as usery. Uh and so this this m makes the business of being a medi somewhat more complicated than it would otherwise have been. Uh the way around it is that you don't explicitly charge interest but you have commissions or uh payment arrangements that in effect uh charge interest. So there are ways around there workarounds. Sorry to interrupt. Just I I think it's worth asking where do the restrictions I mean for two major religions to to take a dim view of this and you put it very diplomatically there >> to have that attitude to lending. There's got to be some pretty serious motivation for that that view. Where does that uh resistance to to the idea of lending come from? >> Well, the love of money uh is the root of all evil. uh those are doubtless lines that you know that there is a recurrent theme uh in in in Christianity that uh that casts a a shadow over the love of money not money itself it's the love of money that's the root of all evil and uh views with some skepticism uh the activity of of money changing >> I think this has quite deep roots that are probably pre-Christian uh somehow it's it's all right if you own a bunch of sheep and the flock naturally increases because the sheep have lambs. But it's it's not okay if that process happens to your flock of money. So there's an aversion to the notion of the natural increase of money uh through interest or the interest that you might get from lending it out. So there's this moral distinction that gets drawn early on between uh it being okay for you to increase your agricultural capital through the natural increase of the sheep, but it's not okay for you to increase your finance capital. that that moral uh approprium that's cast over money lending has an important uh feature because there is a group a religious minority that isn't constrained when it comes uh to lending money at interest and that is the Jews and so part of the issue if you don't know what I'm talking about try Shakespeare's merchant to Venice is that there is a group lending money at interest in Italy indeed in uh much of Europe that is neither Christian or for that matter Muslim. It's a it's a racial uh religious minority comes to be seen as a racial minority and that's part of the reason that that there is a kind of suspicion antagonism towards the lending of money. But is there not also another thing we have this great saying in Russian about borrowing money which is when you when you uh when you borrow money uh you take someone else's money you get someone else's money for a short period of time and when you pay it back you give away your own money forever. there is a dis disconnect in terms of how you feel about the process and I mean I don't know what the ethmology of the term usery means but there's a sort of I think instinctive feeling that people have which is that someone who gives you money and charges you for that it's almost like if you borrow I don't know a rake from your neighbor to rake your garden they wouldn't charge you for it so why would you charge me for borrowing 100 quid >> so that kind of uh argument is is quite common not only in in Eastern Europe but in in Western Europe too. And I think one explanation for this is that if you go back to the medieval and early modern period, interest rates are quite high. Uh why is that? Well, it's it's risky >> uh to lend money. Uh people who lent money to British kings uh or indeed any European kings would frequently be disappointed because the kings would say, \"You know what? You remember that money I I decided not to pay you and what's your recourse? you don't have any and if you put up too much trouble off with your head. So part of the problem is that that interest rates in the medieval and early modern period are pretty high. I mean double digits uh and and that makes it feel like it's really expensive. You know, credit card rate expensive to to borrow money. I think that's part of the story. Interest rates trend down historically as markets become more liquid, become more efficient uh and risk is reduced because the rule of law starts to protect uh uh creditors. But in the early modern period, it's an expensive thing uh to take out a loan and it's expensive because so many people default on their loans. I think that's the best explanation I can I can really give you. >> Okay. Sorry, France. I just want to come back to because I've interrupted Neil twice on this point. I mean, obviously, if I borrowed your rake for a year and used it uh aggressively to rake my garden and [snorts] the leaves uh and earth in my garden and I give it back to you, it would have worn down somewhat. So, the the rake would in practice be worth less if I borrow your car for a year and say give it back to you and and I say, \"Well, thanks. Thanks very much.\" Uh, and you don't charge me your mug because the car is worth a lot less than it was after I've spent a year driving it around, not worrying too much about it cuz not my car. So, I mean, practice >> and and you have no use for I have no use for it for a year, which I have to find some way of compensating. So, I'm not suggesting it's logical. >> It isn't logical. And and so the the key thing to get across here is let's be clear the the constant drum beat of hostility to money lenders to bankers uh to Jewish bankers to non-Jewish bankers is kind of absurd. It's based on the kind of stupid notion that money doesn't have a price. But of course it has a price just as uh the use of a car for a year or a rake for a year has a price. >> That's right. And uh so I I derailed you only because I think this is an important distinction, but you were talking about the way that Renaissance Europe uh made adaptations that took fin created modern finance or the beginnings of modern finance and you were talking about why they were able to do that. >> I think it's a very striking feature of world history that these things happen in Europe. um they do not happen say in China which has a much simpler monetary system uh which has a uh system of coinage uh no real system of public debt a fairly basic and rather low yield system of taxation China's empire runs on different rails why is that and the I think most plausible answer which I also try to explore in a book called civilization is that Europe is divided in to a lot of relatively samesized polities. Uh and these polities are in aggressive competition with one another. They regularly make war on one another. Periodically one of them will try to create a Europeanwide empire and the others then band together to stop that. And and war is in many ways the the driver of financial innovation in in Europe. uh and it just takes a very different form from the geopolitics of East Asia which is characterized by one fairly large uh and more or less homogeneous empire with a relatively low uh low-level financial system with taxes as a share of GDP much smaller. So one of the lessons of of financial history is that you need to have the kind of stress of regular warfare to propel financial innovation forwards as well as to propel scientific innovation exploration. People are motivated by a sense that there isn't enough money for the needs of uh of the state. And that's why you set sail for the Americas uh thinking you're going to the Indies, you're looking for precious metal. That's why you sit down come up with the idea of public debt. Hey, wouldn't it be a good idea if the rich people lent the government money to fight the war? These innovations, I think, are propelled by the imperatives of geopolitical conflict in Europe. >> But in a way that we talk about the borrowing and the attitudes to people who lent us money, is that why Shakespeare talked about a pound of flesh when it came to Shillock? Well, if you think about the merchant of of Venice, uh Shillock is trying to collect on a debt, but decides uh when it's clear that he can't be paid that he will take full advantage of uh what he thinks is his power as a a creditor >> and demand the death of uh the debtor. And that leads of course to uh his coming a cropper because as Shakespeare makes clear uh that's actually a wicked thing to do. Absolutely. And but it's also there's a hypocrisy there because as we've alluded to without borrowing, without taking essentially financial risk, innovation can't happen. And that's innovation whether it comes to exploration, whether it comes to setting up a business, whether it comes to, you know, a government for instance, building infrastructure, we need to borrow. This is essential, isn't it? >> Well, it's very risky. I mean, Charlott's being asked to finance uh oceanic trade. Uh and ships sink quite regularly in those days. So there's quite substantial risk in financing any uh maritime trade. Uh that that's of course the the side of things which would make you sympathetic to Shillock before he decides to go uh for the pound of flesh. But I I mean I think the point you make is a really critical one just as there's a a cost to my borrowing a car uh for a year or for that matter a tractor. Um, so so there's a a cost uh uh to to my borrowing uh £100,000 uh to start a business and anybody who's going to bet on my business being successful will need to be compensated for the risk and and that's at the heart of almost all financial transactions. What's the appropriate compensation? Because there are risks. One risk is the default risk which Shalock encounters. Ah sorry I can't pay the ships all sank. What can I do? was the weather. But there's other risk too. Suppose that we contract this debt in in pounds. Uh but we do it in the 1970s and uh in the period of uh the loan uh the inflation rate rockets up as it did when I was a kid into above 20%. And so the debtor gets to pay back in these depreciated pounds the purchasing power of which has been reduced in a year by 20%. There's also a risk there. So if you're lending, you ask yourself what's the default risk and what's the depreciation or in in inflation risk that that I am running. Uh an and efficient financial markets to use a term that's been much abused over the years uh deliver if there's uh sufficient information and sufficient liquidity uh they deliver a reasonable price for those risks. And we're talking about risks and one of the stories that you tell in the book which was fascinating which is all about risk is the story of Nathan Rothschild which every every people will know it's a famous name but particularly uh the anti-semmites who will be you know the moment they hear the word Rothschild they immediately they're kind of the light bulbs start pinging. So, let's talk about the story of Nathan Rothschild, cuz that's a story about financial risk, lending, but also vast amounts of wealth that come as a result of that. >> Yes. The story of uh how the Rothschilds uh made their first million is a famous one. It's even been made in uh two movies a couple of times uh once by the Nazis. Uh and and that uh gets to your point that this story has often been used uh by anti-Semitic writers. I I wrote uh a history of the Rothschilds back in the 1990s based on the archives of the the bank uh here in London and tried to tease out what had really happened. Uh, and it's important to tell these stories with historical documentation and and as much accuracy as you can muster because it's really the only possible antidote to the the anti-semitic myths that the myth says that in a somewhat illicit way the Rosschilds uh make money from the outcome of the battle of Waterloo uh while heroic Frenchmen and uh Britain's not to mention Germans are perishing in the in the battle. uh they're profiting. Uh so what really was going on? What was going on was that Britain uh uh other European countries uh fought recurrent wars with France from the 1790s from the period after the French Revolution right up until the battle of of Waterloo in 1815. [snorts] uh and uh a variety of different instruments were used to finance uh these wars including bonds which the British government was able to issue in substantial quantities and bankers and the Rothschilds were one of a very significant number of bankers uh who contributed to financing the war effort against revolutionary and then Napoleonic France. One of the most important things that the Rothschild brothers did, there were five uh in the course uh of the period prior to 1815. Uh they left Frankfurt and established themselves in five different uh financial locations. Uh that was the original base in Frankfurt. Uh there was a house in Vienna. Uh a house in Naples, a house in Paris and a house in London. These five houses of Rothschild contributed primarily by advancing gold uh to the armies in the field. If you're an armed uh force uh marching your way, say up from Spain uh towards France, uh you really can't pay with uh paper. The locals want to have hard currency. And so part of the challenge was getting the gold to where it was needed ultimately by the Duke of Wellington's army and the Rosschilds had been involved in those transactions as well as other transactions uh occasioned by the Napoleonic Wars. Okay, this is where it gets exciting. So the Napoleonic Wars appeared to be over before 1815. It appeared that Napoleon had been defeated uh and he had been sent into exile and on the aisle of Ela and peace had arrived. And when uh peace arrived uh there was uh significantly less need for the gold that had been used uh to uh finance his ultimate defeat. When Napoleon makes a comeback for a 100 days in 1815 and culminate at the battle of Waterloo, the [snorts] Rosschilds of course are scrambled into action again to help finance uh another campaign against Napoleon. But nobody knows how long it's going to last. And indeed, it's reasonable to expect a long time because Napoleon has an incredible record of military success. And he's back, the emperor is back. He appears to be back in control of France. uh when the news breaks that he's been defeated in the battle of Waterloo, it takes a while for that news to spread. No internet, no telegraphs. The only way you can actually get news around Europe in 1815 is to have guys on horseback riding to the Channel Coast, handing the message to somebody in a boat who gets across the channel, hands the message to another guy on a horse, horse gallops to London, news is delivered. The Rothschilds clearly got the news before the British government that Napoleon had been defeated. So their couriers were faster and this certainly was part of the reason that they were able to make a significant amount of money. But as I showed in the book, The House of Rothschild, also known as the world's banker in all good bookshops, there was a terrible moment when they thought they had actually blown up because they didn't expect Napoleon to lose. They'd expected a protracted campaign and they had accumulated a lot of gold in the expectation of that continued campaign. When they heard the news that it was all over and he lost again, there's a moment of panic within uh the the brotherhood. They're writing to one another, who has the money? I thought you had the money, but wait, where's the money? They really thought they'd overextended themselves and were about uh to come a cropper. Now, Nathan Rothschild was not the eldest brother, but he was the smartest brother. He was the one uh in London. And and Nathan was one of these people who can, as they say in New York, turn on a dime. As soon as he realizes what's happened, Nathan radically shifts the position and and goes long British government bonds, known to this day as guilts. He goes long British bonds because he he thinks peace is now here. It's all over. These bonds are going to rally. In other words, interest rates are going to come down. We're going to peaceime economy. And it's that trade, buying bonds before the rest of the market knew that Napoleon had been defeated that made them a million pounds, which at that time was a lot of money. That's what really happened. Um, and it then becomes part of the mythology of the Rothschilds uh right down to the present day. Where is the the the the allegation of cynicism or sinister behavior within within that? where where is the divergence between what you're telling which is what happened and and the myths >> beginning really not long afterwards in the 1820s uh particularly in in France critics of the Rothschilds who certainly included people sympathetic to Bonapart who were hostile to the restored royal regime began to portray all of this in a somewhat scurless light and there are two kind of pieces to this one is well you heroic. People are laying down their lives and they're sitting in London uh making money. And the second one is uh well, there's some kind of insider knowledge. There's something disreputable about the fact that they frontr run the market before even the British government knows uh knows the story. But but that's sort of not enough for for a conspiracy theory to have legs, >> right? And so quite quickly what you get is this uh element of the supernatural that there's something really not quite right about the fact that they can know this uh so early uh and and so you get the legend of uh a kind of talisman that protects the family and makes and makes the success of the business. And this idea that there's a secret power at work is interesting because it exists in the anti-semitic literature or the anti-roths literature and it exists in uh Jewish literature including in Russia with the notion that there's something magical about this family. They're kind of the super Jews and the Rothschild refers to themselves as you know the royal family of Judaism. And so this idea that there's something kind of more to it than just business acumen I think is part of what fuels uh this really powerful uh conspiracy theory. I mean, I think what's interesting is it it morphs into a series of apocryphal sayings along the lines of, you know, the time to invest is when there's blood in the streets, >> uh, or that, you know, the sound of of of guns or of cannon fire is is a a chance to make money. That those apocryphal sayings arise in the course of this uh of of this story morphing into a myth. At the start of a new year, everyone talks about resolutions, but most people try to brute force change with willpower alone and burn out by February. But have you ever thought about hypnosis as a solution? Hypnosis gets a bad rap, but it's not a gimmick. It's a legitimate therapeutic tool backed by research. And when it comes to weight loss, it can be a gamecher. Hypnotio is a self-hypnotherapy app that helps you break bad eating patterns by working at the subconscious level where the real habits live. It's for people who are done with willpower only plans. Hypnosio helps you tackle emotional eating, stress related cravings, and food anxiety using proven techniques that reduce cortisol, improve portion control, and build long-term habits, all in a way that fits into real life from your phone, tablet, or your computer. Clinical studies show that users lost twice as much weight as those using traditional diets alone, and 94% maintain that weight loss more effectively over time. It's not about hacks. It's about fixing the deeper programming. Hypnosis based programs reduce BMI and emotional eating significantly compared to standard diets. So, what are you waiting for?

I wonder how much of it is the end of the reign of kings as well because the way you described it when it came to kings in medieval Europe made so much sense to me. Of course, if I'm the king and I want to fight a war against France, I'm going to borrow money from whoever's going to lend it to me. It's it would be very very strange in that situation to blame the lender for the war. That doesn't make any sense. But as you inch towards slightly uh less obviously visible people borrowing money the government whatever that is you know not saying that necessarily happened with the Napoleonic wars but just as you start to head towards democracy you can see why it's almost like well who is responsible for this and of course this modern narrative exists all the way through to you know the military-industrial complex and and so on. There's always this narrative that wars aren't being fought by people in charge of governments who either have real geopolitical geostrategic concerns or they want to show that they've got a bigger penis than the other guy or whatever it might be. It really is, you know, the shadowy figures in the background who who just want to make money from it. >> I think that's right. In the course of the 19th century, which is over time an increasingly democratic age where more or less everywhere there are widening of the franchise, politics changes and one of the targets of the more democratic politics is the relationships between bankers uh and politicians. And you get this in in most countries. In the United States, there was always a skepticism about financial power. It was right at the uh earliest stages of the republic uh that you had the debate over whether there should even be a central bank. Uh the decision not to allow New York to have too much political power to create Washington DC is part of resistance particularly by the southern founders to Alexander Hamilton's vision of a quite British form of United States in which all power financial and political would be concentrated. uh in in New York. So the 19th century debate uh evolves in interesting ways uh to to offer a critique of those who run the financial markets and the Rosschars were the dominant financial family for most of the 19th century far bigger than say JP Morgan who was a a newcomer new on the block in the late 19th century. The the the Rothschilds and finance become almost synonymous with one another. the relationship between that financial world and the political world of kings and of ministers, prime ministers and and finance ministers. Now, those relationships existed. Of course, they existed because the governments are consistently encountering the problem. We seem to have a deficit, your majesty, and uh here's the choice. Raise taxes or call the Rothschilds. Uh obviously politically more convenient to go down the borrowing route. These relationships exist. They're documented. There's correspondence. I spent a great deal of my time in the '90s piecing all that together. The critique that comes from Democratic political figures is, well, there's something not quite right about this. I mean, A, aren't they making a crazy amount of of money and surely that's ultimately taxpayers money? Uh, and B, isn't it a little bit cozy that the prime minister is so close to Rothschild that uh oh, his daughter's just married a member of the family? Those are the critiques, but they come from both the left and the right. And this is a really important thing. The critique of finance or finance capitalism is a social uh socialist critique. It's there in Marx, but it also becomes a critique on the far right. And in the 1820s, those distinctions aren't yet clear. They're just radicals. And radicals don't like this. They don't like the Rothschars. They don't like the restored monarchy. By the time you get to the 1840s, 1850s, there are two flavors. You can be a Marxist, a social democrat, uh you can be for the workers and against uh the capitalists, but that's not quite strong enough drink for you. Then you can join the nent radical right which ultimately evolves uh through populism into fascism. And you say, you know what, the real story here is the Jews uh are taking the money of of the Christians. And that's that's I think the kind of bifocation that you see in the democratic politics of the of the 19th century. Isn't doesn't a lot of this anger, resentment, frustration come from people who don't really understand money, they don't understand finance, they don't understand the bond market. So where you have this absence of knowledge, what then gets fed into it is conspiracy theories, anger, resentment, which then leads to anti-semitism, resentment, which then leads to movements like communism, socialism, etc., fascism. I think one of the odd things about the way education evolves in the course of the 19th century is that while we generally agree that it's a good idea to teach people uh literacy and numeracy, not to mention some history and maybe a foreign language, we never really sit down and teach them about finance. And indeed, financial illiteracy is a very striking feature of our world today. It's a very complex financial world. Everybody is expected soon after they uh leave education uh and perhaps even before then to understand how a loan works uh even if it's just a student loan. Uh we we expect people intuitively to know how interest rates work uh when they've probably only encountered the concept in a in a mathematics class. So we have that problem that nobody really quite understands what a bond yield is. That is still true. I read just the other day in a newspaper uh that some uh uh British political uh figure didn't actually understand what a bond yield was. I remember in noticing at Harvard when I was teaching a financial history course which was a popular course that quite a few of the teaching fellows the graduate students couldn't in fact explain very well to the undergraduates what bond yields were. So I think it's true that ignorance is one of the precursors to to conspiracy theories. when you actually explain what an interest rate is uh and and what risk is the kind of risk that you run if if you're a lender uh why being a banker can give you sleepless nights I think it becomes a little less mysterious why uh the Rothschilds became wealthy from the very outset they ran colossal risk uh not only in 1814 15 but recurrently through the 19th century they take on the risk for example of financing rail railways they're very early to see the potential and railways are the big capital expenditure. They're the data centers of the 19th century. But to a large extent, these railroads in in Britain and and Western Europe are built by private finance. Further east, it's the government that does it. There's enormous risk involved in building a railroad. It's an extremely expensive undertaking. Uh it's pretty unregulated market and a lot of companies that built railroads did not make money and indeed went bust. So I think people don't have a good understanding of risk. Uh nor do they have a good understanding of the difference between risk and uncertainty. Uh something I tried to explain in the ascent of money. It goes back to a distinction the Chicago economist Frank Knight drew about 100 years ago. Risk is calculable. I mean I roughly know the probability that each one of us will experience a car accident in the next year. We we can kind of put a number on that because it's fairly normally distributed. We all can figure out what our risk of uh being diagnosed with cancer is. Mine's higher than yours cuz I'm older than you. All that's calculable. And so when we're calculating how much we should pay in health insurance, that isn't actually tremendously difficult to figure out. But what is the probability of war breaking out? Uh that involves Britain. Actually, that's impossible to say. What's the probability there'll be another pandemic? Nobody knows. When will there be a huge earthquake uh in San Francisco that completely up up uh uh ends Silicon Valley? Nobody knows. So that's the domain of uncertainty. So anybody who's embarking on a largecale investment whether they're lending the money or buying the equity, we'll come to that in a minute, is taking on risk. Some of it's calculable and some of it's not. And that is ultimately at the heart of capitalism, the cost of risk and uncertainty. >> You know, one of the things to pick up on there is you corrected me and I'm grateful for your correction and that you wrote your book before the financial crisis. I didn't know about that because I became aware of it shortly after. Um what what did you see that other people didn't see? >> [snorts] >> So in 2006 uh there were a couple of uh red lights that that were flashing on the dashboard and I wrote about it at the the time. Uh there was a lot of debt accumulating in the financial system. Uh household debt particularly uh the famous subprime mortgages uh loans that were taken out by relatively lowincome families to buy uh homes. But there was also a lot of debt on bank balance sheets. And then there was debt that was not on their balance sheets in various uh offbalance sheet vehicles. Part one. Part two, the cost of debt interest rates uh uh were rising and therefore there was going to be a steady and sustained squeeze on any vulnerable borrowers, anybody who had overextended or any institution that was under capitalized. You could see that. I could see that from late 2006. And [snorts] I think the moment of truth for me was when one of my friends, Jim Tish of Lowe's Corporation, sat me down with his mortgage specialist and she showed me a chart of when the subprime mortgages would reset. Because the way the subprime mortgages worked was that you had a sweetener period when the payments that you had to make per month were relatively low, artificially low, >> but they reset after a certain period of time to a much higher market rate. And those resets were pretty much pre-programmed to happen uh in the course of ' 07. And so you could see that the trouble would start to build in uh the course of 2007 uh and then finally would spill over uh in the full-blown crisis uh that that we saw in 2008. First Bear Sterns, then layman Brothers because the overextended investment banks were really the weak link. The interesting thing looking back on it is how few people saw that. Uh that was partly because if you were making money in the market, you were incentivized not to see it. if the music is still playing, we'll keep dancing. That was what Chuck Prince, one of the bank CEOs, famously said. But I think there was also a kind of failure on the part of of some economists fully to understand the precariousness of the the debt dynamics. And in some ways, it's an advantage to be an economic historian because you don't have some fancy mathematical model that you have to focus on. you're really just looking to spot pattern rec rec do pattern recognition to see uh well we've seen this kind of debt dynamic before. I think it's important to bring into the conversation something we haven't talked about yet which is the equity market because we've talked about banks, we've talked about bonds, but we haven't talked about the stock market. And that's funny because actually people typically focus a lot more on the stock market than they do on the bond market. And certainly in the United States, most conversations about the about Wall Street are really conversations about the stock market. And it's worth just understanding that because it was collateral damage in the financial crisis. I mean, equity markets tanked uh in the wake of the the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, but it wasn't really at the heart of the crisis. So let's just quickly do a refresher on that because stocks uh or equities are just a way in which we can own a piece of a business a piece of a company uh whether it's Apple or Alphabet uh or a much smaller company if it's a publicly traded company you can go and buy a little piece of its equity of its capital uh there's more risk involved because the company can go bust and you get nothing if that happens. But there's more upside because if the company is Nvidia and you were smart enough to buy Nvidia stock on the eve of the launch of Chat GPT, then your upside is massively bigger than in any other asset class. I wanted to throw that in because >> if you want to understand how the financial system works, you've got to populate it with all the different components of course >> and they kind of they accumulate over time. There's no equity market prior to the 18th century. That's essentially when you start to see something like a modern stock market emerge. Similarly, there isn't really much of an insurance market in the modern sense. Uh until the 18th century and and the 19th century and that brings us perfectly to where we are today because one of the ingredients Francis mentioned ignorance but another ingredient I think is pain. Uh another ingredient is uh terrible economic times. Another ingredient is war. Another ingredient are basically times when people feel that something has gone wrong. And the rise of the radical left and the radical right is something that I think is happening in our society today. I think it's undeniable. Uh you know here in the UK the Zach Palanskis of the world in in the US you have both the radical left and the radical right. And you know we've spoken to people on both sides of that. It's happening. I I I don't know how you feel about it. I mean, you've talked a lot about the indebtedness levels, and it's obvious that's a huge problem. Are we headed in a sort of 1920s direction, 1930s direction? >> Well, it's a good question because the ideologies are the same old same old. >> Yeah. >> I mean, it's sort of depressing that we can't come up with new material, but here we are again. [laughter] It's like the writers have just gone home and we're stuck with oh I'm really disillusioned. Um what can I what can I have for my disillusionment? It's like well sir we can offer you we can offer you Marxism um if you'd like that or if you if you'd rather something stronger we've got some anti-semitism. So it's essentially Zoran Mandani or Nick Fuentes and that's like really we we got a hundred years on the clock and it's those guys again. >> That's somewhat disappointing. I feel we could be more creative. maybe we're not reading enough manga. >> Um, you know, we're we're we're we're short of new ideas. So, the question is, do we get the macroeconomic context in which those ideas come in from the margins and become very popular? Cuz right now, the people attracted to the extreme ideas are still clearly a minority. >> I think I mean, sorry to interrupt, Neil, but Manny's mayor of New York. >> Yeah, but it he's not going to be president of the United States. I mean remember New York politics is is not at all representative of US politics and and and >> I'm just making the point they are making inroads >> oh unquestionably but the key question is you know do we have enough economic volatility of the kind they had in the 20s and 30s to propel today's uh wannabe Hitler into a position of of political power and lots of so-called far-right populists aspiring to power and uh the question is how many get there and obviously how radical are when they get there. Same question for the left. New York can take a kind of punt on socialism. Maybe Minneapolis might do it too, but I'm not sure that many other cities are going to do it. But remember, all this is happening after a period of sustained economic expansion where economists have predicted several of the last zero recessions. Apart from the shock of the March 2020 onset of co the economy has essentially been uh on expansion mode certainly in the US since the financial crisis there hasn't been that much uh in the way of uh of volatility by the standards of the 20th century. So when Andrew Rossin publishes his new book 1929, we're all supposed to read it looking for traces of the the 1920s in the 2020s. And of course there are some because there are 1920s people offering projects of implausible uh economic viability. Uh step forward Sam Alman of Open AI. Uh there's margin credit. There are traders uh who buy stocks on the yolo principle. You only [laughter] live once uh or on the FOMO principle because they have fear of missing out. That's all quite 1920s. So what's the probability that we get the great shock of 29 followed by a decade of depression as we did in the 1930s? That is very low probability because we're unlikely to make the policy mistakes that were made back then >> which were what >> well the key lesson of the great depression uh is that the Federal Reserve did almost everything wrong uh everything to make matters worse. uh and when I was trying to navigate uh through the financial crisis after I published the book I did a lot of talks in a lot of institutions the question was always is it the great depression and I would say well no because Ben Bernani who was then the Fed chair knows the financial history of the great depression and he's not going to do what the Fed did then which was actually to tighten monetary policy uh and that had the effect of causing multiple bank failures persistently right the way through from late 29 fine all the way until Franklin Roosevelt is sworn in and finally shuts down all the banks uh in the famous Roosevelt bank holiday. We're not going to do that again. No central banker would make those mistakes again. And we've in in a sense we've run the experiment because when the financial crisis happened, the Fed and other central banks did what came to be euphemistically called quantitative easing. I.e. they expanded the balance sheet. They bought lots of stuff that was otherwise going to tank in price. They bailed out key financial players and we didn't have a great depression and that's I think therefore it's reasonable to assume that we're not going to have a great depression when the next recession hits which eventually it will. Uh my student Tyler Goodspeed has a brilliant book coming out early next year called Recession which everyone will have to read. Uh showing what it takes to cause a recession and it's usually more than one thing that goes wrong. I think we will get at some point enough bad news to check the capex boom uh in AI. We'll get enough bad news uh maybe geopolitical bad news to make investors much more worried than they currently are about Taiwan. U at some point I'll be sitting here with you guys talking about how we got into the latest financial mess. But I doubt very much that that financial mess will lead to the kind of uh economic pain that we saw in the 1930s without which it's hard to believe so many authoritarian leaders would have come to power. It's very hard to imagine the com collapse of German democracy and the advent of Hitler without the huge shocks of hyperinflation in 1923 and then a crash a crash where I mean employment unemployment is like north of 25%. In Germany by 1932 I I can't see us going there again. So the bad ideologies they're back and they never really went away. They're just back and somewhat attractive to me. The weird thing is that they're attractive at a time of relative economic prosperity when there really isn't that much pain. You mentioned pain. Well, we ain't seen pain. >> Mass immigration, mass illegal immigration is probably a big driver of it. Uh and I think maybe that's where some of the appeal is coming. >> Unquest unquestionably. So, and but the interesting thing about that is that if you cut it off, which is happening in both the US, >> you're going to get economic depression. Well, there'll be economic problem, not a depression, but you'll have some there's some economic cost to that. Uh it's hard to run the NHS without uh immigrants. I would assume it's the US economy without cheap labor from the south runs in a very different way. And so all of the changes that are currently being made in response to disillusionment about immigration will have some kind of as yet unclear economic cost. >> Yeah, it's got to be calibrated correctly. I certainly feel that in the UK I don't know how reliant Britain is on boat crossings from France. No, >> I don't think we are relying on that at all. In fact, I think it's a massive cost and drain on the economy. >> Absolutely. >> Um, but there's one other thing on on economics and finance that I think is a giant problem and I I wonder if you know how it's ever going to get solved, which is we don't seem to be able to live within our means. And this is where, you know, Francis did, I think, as good a job as anyone can do of making the case why borrowing can be a really useful tool and it has been. It allows civilization to grow fast. It allows us to do things before we otherwise would have been, take risks, etc. But when you become addicted to it in the way that we have, I mean, we really are in trouble in that aspect of things, are we not? A mate of mine tries to quit vaping every new year. Every time he fails for the same reason. It removes a habit but never replaces a ritual. That sounds like you, this will help. If you're part of the 50% of people who attempt to quit vaping every year, you need to equip yourselves with the right tools for the job. And there's no better tool to break up with vaping or smoking than this episode sponsor, Fume. FUM, pronounced fume, is an award-winning flavored air device used by more than half a million customers. Here's why. Fume is twice as effective as the solutions you've tried and it's backed by lab tested safety studies. So both doctors and customers agree that it's the good habit. It's also onethird of the cost of your bad habit. When mine arrived, first thing I noticed was the feel. It's weighted, sleek, and fidget friendly with a subtle magnetic click that keeps your hands busy. The twisty barrel and airflow dial make the whole experience feel controlled and intentional. My favorite flavor is crisp mint. It's fresh, natural, zero nicotine, and there are no batteries, heat, or vapor involved. Just a clean burst of flavor when you need something to replace the old routine. Start your guilt-free journey with the good habit. And use code trigg to get a free gift with your purchase. Head to tryume.com/trig. That's trf.com/trig. and use code trig to start the good habit today. >> I mean, we really are in trouble in that aspect of things, are we not? >> Yes, deep trouble. >> If you borrow to invest uh uh and you acquire some productive asset, then what's not to like? Uh it'll probably help you repay the debt. But if you borrow to consume, well, that way [snorts] lies trouble. And that's what we've been doing. Let let's put it really simply. the systems of public debt that evolved in the 20th century to finance wars, particularly the world wars after the 1945 uh allied victory began dra to transition to to financing welfare. So we went from warfare to welfare states. those welfare states which evolved in the 40s and then got another uh expansion in the 60s assume certain demographic features about fertility and longevity which have completely changed. So we now don't have really any countries outside of subsaran Africa where fertility is above replacement rate 2.1 uh children on average per woman and we have in most countries retirement ages that were kind of devised in the midentieth century while life expectancy is steadily increased and people can expect therefore to spend substantial parts of their lives retired our welfare states can't cope with that on either side of the Atlantic in the US the real driver of the uh debt and the deficit is social security to retirement program and Medicare, free health care for the elderly. In the UK, you have a whole system of benefits that can trace back to the Atly government after 1945. It's all inacronistic and it's really hard to reform. Why is it hard to reform? Because there's a very very powerful constituency that likes the status quo called the elderly and they're a huge proportion of the electorate and dependably vote. I thought think I read the other day that 40% of the German electorate more than 40% is now above retirement age. So you can't get radical reforms through uh with that basic obstacle. Nobody who tries to reform these welfare states survives politically. Emanuel Macron has been dead in the water since France. Why? Because he tried to make a microscopic increase in the French retirement age and he's been twisting in the wind ever since. This is the problem. What does it lead to? It leads to there being deficits every year. And not just in the bad years, which is wrong. The deficit every year in the US, six plus% of GDP every year as far as the I can see. Gross debt now above 120% of GDP higher than it was at the end of World War II. Uh this is not sustainable. Ferguson's law, which I I promulgated in January because everybody should have a law and I decided I would have [laughter] So I I I said Ferguson's law states that any great power that spends more interest payments on its debt than on defense won't be great for much longer. Well, the UK stopped being a great power a long time ago. It's been in violation of Ferguson's law for many years. But the US only crossed this threshold last year and it's going to stay well above it for foresee for the foreseeable future until by about 2040. I think I worked it out. The US will spend twice as much on debt service on debt interest as it spends on defense. These are completely unsustainable trends. Problem is politically nobody wants or dares to go there. And so your next question is going to be so how does this end Neil? >> How does it end? And that's that's the big question. And there are a finite number of options very very limited range of options. Happy ever after option. Okay. It has been done. You can have a really large debt and you can grow your way out of it. That's what Britain did after the Napoleonic wars going back to the time of the Rothschilds. Britain just ran primary budget surplus and grew thanks to the industrial revolution. So that's the good way out. If that's to happen here in the 2020s, we need AI to be every bit as good as Samton says it is and the productivity growth to be so great that in a couple of years time, this podcast will be generated by GPT6 and you guys will be out of a job. So that's that's the good news that productivity gains will get you out of jail. >> Do I think that's likely? No, I think it's quite unlikely. I think it's unlikely >> social consequences to that out as well. >> It would I think you would not be the only agrieved people in this scenario. There'll be an entire generation of people with university degrees who wouldn't even be Uber drivers cuz the cars would also be driving themselves. Plan B. So then you kind of default. You say go back to the medieval monarch approach. Uh you know that money uh that we owe you, I don't know, but I'm I'm really sorry about this. I just I don't know how to pay you. Defaulting on the bond holders is something that used to be more or less uh recurrent every decade experience in Latin America. Uh but if you default on the people who receive benefits, particularly old age benefits, I don't know. I'm I'm just thinking you better have a plan for the private sector because your political career will be cut very short. What about plan C? How about how about we inflate it all away? How about we do what we did repeatedly after World War II and we just reduce the real value of all these liabilities with a big sudden uh unexpected increase in inflation. Yeah, that's going to be pretty unpopular too. The other problem is that a lot of the liabilities these days are index linked cuz we went through this once before and then the decision was let's not do that again. Let's make sure that we can't inflate away the debt. So the number of ways out of this problem is pretty small. I think what ends up happening is some combination of default where in practice we reduce what we said we would pay out and some element of inflation. We inflate away uh or use financial repression some of the liabilities. None of which is going to be fun particularly for the people who've got significant uh amounts of money. they expect to receive from government uh or the people who've accumulated lots of pounds or dollars in savings. But I don't see any other way out. >> And it's not just the Western world. I was reading about this. China's got a debt of 17.8 trillion. The ch Chinese debt's interesting because it's mostly at the local level and it tends to kind of get passed over by people who are taken in by Xiinping is awesome. But actually Xiinping is not awesome. the public finances of of China, if you drill down, are about as bad as those of the United States. It's just that it's mostly local government debt. If you if you add up the liabilities of the public sector, about the same relative to GDP, and the deficit, the Chinese deficit might be even larger. The IMF did a study, I think it was a couple of years ago now, where they calculated that the real deficit of the entire public sector was more like like 15 16% of GDP. So, China has this problem. Of course it does because it has a very rapidly aging population and its fertility rate has collapsed. So the demographics are the real driver here. If you leave your system unadjusted, it's just going to go insolvent unless you have a miracle rise in fertility. That's vanishingly un improbable, very very unlikely. Uh or you might have a pandemic that really kills the elderly rather than just kind of half-heartedly does the way CO did. So those like like those seem like pretty unlikely solutions. You're finally going to be forced whether you're China, Europe, the UK, the United States to do something radical. And this is where Mr. Mille is interesting. Uh the Argentine president is the only really fiscally radical leader in the world. He's the only one who's serious about this who in his first year as president said I'm reducing the deficit from 5% of GDP to zero. And he did it. So you know Malay has shown that you can be radical but what's really interesting is you have to be as the Argentines were staring at 200 300% inflation. You have to have your economy just flat face down in the ground to get the votes to do the radical stuff. >> Well, look on the bright side, Neil. That's probably going to happen. [laughter] >> I console myself that in the end everybody is Argentina eventually that they'll [laughter] get there and then everybody needs Malay. >> Neil, what a pleasure. We could carry on uh this conversation for many many hours. It's always a fascinating insight. Final question is always the same. What's the one thing that we're not talking about that we really should be? >> Well, I maybe we have been talking about it. I'm always struck by how much less fun these conversations are, conversations about money than >> Thanks, mate. Conversations about sex or political extremism. And I actually think we've just had the conversation that a lot of people would rather not have cuz culture war is more fun. I mean, the culture war is just much more fun. But but >> is it really a woman? >> But my message is right. [laughter] >> You see already we have laughed. >> Yeah. >> But I think we're talking right now what we've just done is we talked about the difficult nasty gnarly stuff that isn't going to go away. I mean you may not be interested in financial history. Financial history is interested in you. And those who don't understand debt dynamics, those who enter adulthood without a clue about how interest rates work, who don't know what a bond yield is, who've never made an investment in the stock market and never will, those people will have worse lives than the people who get informed. So the thing about the stuff I do at core, it's boring but important. And if you can't get your head around the stuff that's boring but important, if you can't bear to get through the ascent of money because you just rather watch Nick Fuentes on YouTube, you will be poor and I will laugh. [laughter] >> There we go. Fantastic, Neil. Fantastic. Thank you very much. [music]"

    "transcript": "So the Madura regime is what's called a cartel, the cartel of the sons. Uh this all began, I mean these investigations have been ongoing for over 10 years independently at the Department of Justice. And one of the things Chavez did in the early 2000s is that most countries have cooperation agreements with the DEA, the Drug Enforcement Administration, to stop drug trafficking. South America is a big source of drug trafficking. Why? Because it's mostly produced in Colombia. That's why the US opened military bases there and really fought it hard under the Oriva presidency. Uh and then now under Petra obviously it's all gone overboard. But uh Chavis stopped the cooperation with the US government and that was purposeful. That's because they thought that that was actually their best revenue source. Um they destroyed the oil industry so they ran out of oil to steal. What they didn't destroy because it's not government-owned is the drug trafficking industry. And so the generals of the Venezuelan military, this is part of how they remain in power. The military is the cartel. And the military knows that if Venezuela were to become a democratic country, obviously generals cannot be drug kingpins no matter who comes to power in an election. And that's why they will never give in power peacefully. That's another discussion that we can talk about. Um but the point is they became a cartel. They uh don't mainly produce the drugs there. It's mostly from Colombia, from FARC, ELN, these other military groups. They bring it through Venezuela. And because Venezuela is an arco state, the government itself endorses this. They use government planes to transport drugs. They use all the state infrastructure to do it. Nicholas's Maduros's nephews were captured by the DA in Haiti with kilos of cocaine. They were brought here. They went to trial. They were declared guilty. And then Biden pardoned them and sent them back. >> What? >> Oh yeah. This happened a few years ago under Biden. It was all part of an exchange for for American prisoners. Uh and he released the nephews the nephews of the dictator. I mean this is how high up it is. I mean how close do you want to get? It's his own family. So that that is why they do it because it's a big source of revenue. It's a way to create a clientele of people in power that have the weapons to remain in power. And how much cocaine do we know how much cocaine is being trafficked from Venezuela to the United States? >> So my understanding is that it's about 20% of the cocaine that gets to the United States comes from Venezuela. Uh it's not a majority but but it's a it's a huge portion and uh but I mean I don't know how credible it is the the amounts uh but it really comes from Colombia. That's where it's produced and then Venezuela helps with the transportation. Part of it also goes to Europe. It's not all to the United States. uh goes through the islands of the Caribbean, sometimes on flights, sometimes on boats like the boats we've seen, they've stricken in the in the Caribbean and and then ultimately also through Mexico. Right. >> Well, these boats that uh that have been destroyed by US strikes. Are they narco boats? What do we know about them? >> I I am certain that they are. I have no. So, one of the things is right now there's a very lively discussion in the United States over whether this is legal, whether this is good, whether these people need to brought to trial. Look, I can tell you at least me personally as a Venezuelan, I fully support the Trump administration's strikes on drug boats in the Caribbean. And the overwhelming majority of Venezuelans even post on their personal social media jokes about it. They love it. They're like, \"Another one bites the dust.\" uh because this is part of what keeps the regime in power. Now, are the strikes going to overthrow Maduro by themselves striking boats? No. More would need to be done. But is it a good thing because these people are evil and have destroyed our country? Yes. Well, there was something strange I found because look, this episode might go out a fair while after the events that we're discussing. And by this point, it might all be legal or illegal or, you know, whatever. But I just thought it was quite weird the way the media covered it because they were like, \"Well, one of the people who was hit, you know, was a fisherman.\" And you're going, \"Well, drug cartels will use fisherman to drive boats.\" >> No, no, wait. That person who was, by the way, Colombian, that fisherman was a convicted armed trafficker in Colombia, right? >> Are you telling me that he reformed himself, went to a drug trafficking route to fish, >> right? And >> that sounds fishy. >> Well, that sound fishy. But even if that isn't the case, I mean, just because there was one fisherman on a boat doesn't mean it's not an arco. I mean, drug cartels probably don't have boat training camps. They just get a guy who has a boat or who knows how to do you know what I mean? It's it's kind of silly. >> Now, you might say, \"Well, Daniel, but is is death really the solution?\" Right? I'm going to tell you why this is the appropriate strategy. It is the appropriate strategy because the drug trafficking in Latin America and especially Venezuela and Colombia, it is tied to terrorism. How do you think FARC and ELN the terrorist designated groups by the United States? Not even talking about the Cartel of the Suns yet. >> Sorry, Daniel. There's a lot of people who won't know what FARC is and won't know what EL is. So let's just give us a bit of background and then come back to the >> Yeah, the FARC and Eln are Colombian militias that occupy large portions of Colombia, do bomb attacks, uh kidnap people. They have kidnapped even presidential candidates in Colombia and and they extort businesses in the region and they're funded through drug trafficking. How do you think Hezbollah even gets funding too? He also receives money from drug trafficking. That terrorist groups have found out that the most profitable way to make money is drug trafficking and other criminal activity. It's like the mob did the alcohol and the prostitution and all these things together. It's the same thing that terrorists do. So when you strike the drug trafficking, you strike the funding source of terrorism. >> That's really really interesting. And the other thing I was going to ask you is uh one of the things that I think is probably under discussed is the extent to which Venezuela uh is working with hostile regimes to the United States. >> Absolutely. So Chavez became very good friends with Makmoud Almad when he was president of Iran. Iranians are still very good allies of of their current regime. Uh Vladimir Putin, Xiinping. I mean Russia and China gave him billions and billions of loans that then they forgave. That's all to prop them up because for these regimes having Venezuela there is both a platform uh to attack the United States but also to bother the United States. They know that the drug trafficking kills Americans and harms the West. Why not support them? Uh they know that Maduro and Chavez before him funded communist parties in other countries including Petro in Colombia. Um including Podemos in Spain by the way, the far-left party there uh that is in power. So it it is a very cost-effective way to just fight a an asymmetric war against the west. And yeah, so I I I would say it it is a big problem. I don't know if you remember the when they tried to kidnap the Iranian dissident here in New York City, the these armed assassins, uh the the the objective was kidnapping, but the other option was assassination. The plan was actually to take her to Karacas, not to Iran directly. was much closer. That's because the Iranian regime cooperates with the major regime. The first lady and the and the president of Iran came recently to Venezuela. It was a really funny video. They [laughter] they you know she came in a full black borca and then when she was coming off the plane, Venezuelans put the Star Wars song as she was coming down because that's exactly what what it is. >> Yeah. And and that's the tragedy of Venezuela is that it's become completely corrupted that it's essentially now a vessel for the Iranian regime, but it's also got links to China as well. Well, absolutely. The the Chinese supported Chavis with loans. Um they're still present. I mean, part of how the oil is extracted today in Venezuela is Iranian, Chinese, and Russian companies because the major regime wasn't able to do it themselves. So they're like, \"Hey, let's bring you all of the So it's really funny when the far-lefts in in the United States and other countries say that, oh, this is the United States that wants to overthrow Maduro because of the oil. >> The oil is being taken by Russia, by China, and by Iran. What are you talking about? Where do you think the Venezuelan gasoline comes from now? It comes from Iran. Bring take the oil there. Bring the gasoline back.\" Um the Iranians and I mean those are the imperialist countries that interfere in Venezuela. It's Cuba that did. Venezuelans want to have peaceful free relations with the United States like it used to be. Uh the refineries all along Texas used to be designed to bring Venezuelan heavy oil and refine it there. That's that's what they're designed to do. And if anything, the Madura regime has destroyed oil production. Venezuela used to produce three and a half to four million barrels a day. Now it produces less than a million, about half a million. And the it represents a very real security threat to the United States because I was talking to one of my cousins and he was saying that there's Hezbollah training camps on the island of Margarita. >> You see now people in in Borcas, you see a lot of Islamists in Venezuela. And look people you you might understand that Muslims are immigrating to rich countries because it's a better place to live. Nobody's immigrating to Venezuela because it's a better place to live. How did they show up there? Because they'll work for Iran. That's really simple. It's because of the Hezbollah training camps. Uh not only that, but the the other terrorist organizations I mentioned earlier, FARC and Eln sought refuge from the US uh involvement in Colombia inside Venezuela. Chavez protected them. He even has in one of his State addresses saying that Far County are not terrorist groups. They're just misunderstood people. And not only do they represent a terrorist threat externally to the United States, Venezuela, and I'm ashamed to say this. I it actually pains me and it upsets me to say this. We represent a threat to the United States internally with gangs like Alagua. >> Absolutely. So Venezuela then after 2020 became at a different greater threat to America and the world because now not only was it the drugs which also increased but it's also the migration of hundreds of thousands of people well millions all over the world of course and among them really dangerous young members that you really didn't need to be a genius to identify them. So one of the examples is this woman who crossed the southern border under Biden. She was not sneaking in. She was let in by border patrol. She was checked. You just had to see her picture to know that she shouldn't have been allowed. Okay. Facial tattoos everywhere. Um, this woman was actually a child sex trafficker. And when she came to America, what she did was traffic girls into prostitution. Her name nickname was Barbie. This is all in the New York Post. You can read it, see her photo. Uh, all the other cases in New York City of gang members and uh thieve bands, right? uh shoplifting gangs and that is little. They took over an apartment complex in Aurora, Colorado. I mean, they have done so much and they have even attempted to assassinate Venezuelan dissident in other countries. Two Venezuelan dissidents were almost killed a couple of weeks ago in Colombia by an assassin group. They survived. Thank God. They killed one in Chile. Their goal is to it's not that most Venezuelans or even a large uh you know or even a small or significant number are all criminals or whatever coming into the US but that the Venezuelan regime uses the natural migration flow of people who flee them to infiltrate criminals and gang members. >> Well, this is what I was going to ask you because there was one thing that we didn't have in the Soviet Union because it was an authoritarian maybe even totalitarian regime. We did not have criminal gangs that were roaming, kidnapping people, trafficking drugs that like if if you want to talk about the benefits of totalitarianism, crime tends to be really under control, right? As far as I understand, in China, there are no huge gangs that are doing any of this stuff. So, how does a country with an authoritarian socialist regime end up having such a strong presence of organized crime? >> That is such a good observation on your right. Cuba also doesn't have a major crime problem, >> right? >> Uh [snorts] Venezuela is unique among these socialist nations in that it allowed crime to to fester. And I think it was a political strategy. So if you see the the charts of all the independent groups of the crime rate, homicide rate, kidnapping numbers, everything of Venezuela, Chavez got elected and sworn into office, linear increase up. Uh Caracas became one of the cities with the highest homicide rates in the planet. Uh and and that was all during my lifetime. It became so dangerous that when I went to parties as a teenager in friends homes, we would stay overnight because we didn't want to be picked up or do or leave in the dark. Uh my own family in the early 2000s were kidnapped in the beach at home. Uh they stole everything. They took our cars. They took our belongings. Um and so this became common place. I have friends who some some of them got robbed two times a day. like it became a joke at this point. It's like are really and like when when they come like they already stole my phone. I can't give it to you. [laughter] >> So we became used to the crime. Uh that was one of the greatest life quality of life improvements for me coming to America was being at peace in the street not thinking that a man in a motorcycle was going to come next to me in the sidewalk and then point a gun at me and say, \"Give me everything you have and then kill me perhaps.\" >> Yeah, we know how you feel coming from London. [laughter] I guess what I'm asking is is the crime and these gangs that we're seeing, particularly the ones that are infiltrating the United States, is that simply a failure of the Venezuelan regime to assert its authority or is there something more nefarious going on? >> I think it's more nefarious. Uh I think that the other authoritarian regimes chose to just quash crime and Maduro and Chavez chose not to. inside Venezuela. The purpose of the gangs was to repress protests. They used these armed groups so that when there were large protests, they would send them. It's called collectivos collectives and they were coming in motorcycles dressed in red and then they would shoot some people, kidnap others, torture them and diffuse the protest that way and then say, \"Oh, that wasn't the police. It was them with Russian weapons, by the way.\" Um, I mean, how else do you get weapons in a country where weapons are illegal, right? uh well the weapons are illegal for the law-abiding citizens not for the gang members and the collectives. So that that's how it all began and then these gangs also grew on themselves, right? Uh they control the prisons uh which are totally packed uh with people. You know, part of what President Trump has said about the gangs is that Madura released the people from the prisons. Actually, the problem is that people just didn't go to prison in the first place. The prisons are actually the place where criminals thrive. They they have chicken inside the prisons. They have banks. They bring in people from outside. There are several good documentaries of people who go into the prisons, Americans and and and others. So I think it was a political strategy at the beginning internal and then when they saw that people were coming to the United States through the border, they're like we can exploit this. So the the gang members came with them. >> Do you think that there's going to be some kind of military action in Venezuela involving the US? >> Uh I hope so. Um, you know, right now where they're where we're only seeing is striking the boats. Trump has hinted at striking inside Venezuela, the land. Look, why do I say I hope so? Because it's really the only way we see this regime end. This regime will not end because they feel pressure uh from sanctions. As much as I support it because I don't think they should get to enjoy the financial benefits of what they stole. It's the just thing to do to sanction the regime. If you want to see a prosperous Venezuela where millions of people aren't fleeing, where criminals aren't going to other countries, where we're actually exporting oil instead of exporting people, uh the only way is for Madura not to be in power and Venezuela become a free country again. >> And I think it's such a good point, Daniel. What people don't understand because Venezuela isn't the focus of most people's attention is this is not sustainable either for Venezuela or actually for the United States and something really does need to be done. >> Indeed. I mean, we're all paying for what socialism did to Venezuela. We're paying it in higher gasoline prices because there are millions of barrels that are not being produced every day from Venezuela. We're all paying it in crime. I mean, how many people have been killed by gang members from Venezuela in the US? Every time I was seeing the news like migrant crime, whatever it's up, I was like, \"Please let it not be Venezuela. Please let it not be Venezuela.\" Venezuela, >> you know, like, \"Oh, please, at least another Latin American nation. Please, come on.\" >> Uh, so that is not a coincidence. And and so we're paying the price. And we would all benefit so much if Venezuela became free, not just Venezuelans. So many people would go back to Venezuela, millions of people. uh and and and I think you know so much suffering has been done people starving so much lost human potential of valuable people that could be innovating and doing good things it's the same thing with the Soviet Union when it was uh still a socialist regime how many smart Russians were there I mean Russia had some of the smartest people in the world that couldn't fulfill their potential and innovate for all the world's benefit because of Soviet socialism >> and a lot of them are here now and in Israel Very true. Very very true. Uh but still it was a loss of human potential course. >> Same in China. Same in so many authoritarian countries. And I think President Trump has the opportunity not only to get a huge win on foreign policy, but to do the greatest foreign policy achievement of the US perhaps in many decades. >> Well, here's the question, Daniel, and I look I think what you're saying I totally get particularly from your perspective. I also think and I think you'd agree with me over the last 20 years regime change is got a bit of a bad rep right and partly I think for very good reasons which is one of the things I think Americans have discovered that you know I always try to explain this to our American friends is like not everyone in the world is American so even if you remove the evil guy at the top they don't necessarily end up in a you know social democracy or liberal democracy or democracy at all so for example you know I think there There's a few people who were a little bit too enthusiastic when the Ukraine war when Russia invaded Ukraine and they were, \"Oh, we just need to get rid of Putin.\" And I was like, \"Well, I I agree with you that what's happening is bad and I'm super pro- Ukraine.\" You remove Putin, I'm not sure you're going to get something better. So, if you're saying, \"Well, it would be better to remove Maduro. I totally get the sentiment, but make the case to me that he's not going to be replaced by Nicholas Paduro and he's even [laughter] worse.\" that that's that's very important and obviously during the last 20 years I mean because of the Iraq war which was a massive mistake right uh trillion dollar mistake um that that's a big problem but people forget that there have been many successful uh use of forces in US foreign policy in the past even in Latin America that led to great prosperity >> tell us about that >> Panama for example Panama today is one of the richest countries in Latin America after the US depos nor uh Granada in Granada they celebrate Thanksgiving on the day of the US intervention in Granada took one day. Now Granada is an island. It's much smaller. Panama had the Panama Canal. I understand it's not the same. But what I'm trying to say is that it can be successful and it has been successful in recent period in the 80s. So what happens in Venezuela is also similar in that we have a democratically elected government. We have an active opposition, something Cuba doesn't have unfortunately. And so we have who with people, you know, uh, a democratic alternative that has massive popular support and we have a re regime that totally depends on drug trafficking. We don't have a country with ethnic or religious division, right? We're not going to have an Iraq Shiite versus Muslim war. Uh, we're not going to have, you know, these ethnic genocides, right, that happen in Africa. It's a very different situation and we don't need troops on the ground either, right? That would be a massive mistake because it would be very costly, right? The US is is simply not capable of doing that in Venezuela, which is a very large country, larger than Iraq, too. So, what President Trump could do is actually strike at the military facilities of the regime and even strike at some of the major regime members such that Maduro gets the message, I need to leave because my life is at risk. And where would he live? The same faith that Bashar lassad had. He will go to Russia probably. I don't think he wants to go to Cuba. It's too poor. So in China, you know, he probably doesn't want to be in Asia. So he'll probably end up in Russia."

    "transcript": "The channeling of so many women of childbearing age into the workforce has had two really big potentially civilization ending consequences. One is the one I've been talking about which is the feminization of institutions. The other is declining birth rates. That too can cause the end of [music] your civilization. I don't think wokeness is an ideology. If it's an ideology, the way we get rid of it is by having better arguments. But if wokeness is an inevitable result of demographic feminization, then [music] we really can't trust that wokeness is over. Relax, relax. This is not an ad.

Just go to triggerpod.co.uk UK or click the link below and join thousands of our supporters who watch all our interviews with exclusive bonus content ad free. >> Helen, welcome to trigonometry. >> Thanks for having me. >> It's great to have you on. Uh you wrote an article based on a speech you gave at the Ncon conference which exploded the internet. I think it's fair to say >> [clears throat] >> uh when superviral caused a lot of debate and discussion and it's basically I mean I'll let you say it in your own words but it's kind of a little bit about how the the fact that women now control or at least represent the majority of the employees at many institutions is one of the reasons that society has gone the way it has. Is that fair? >> I think that's fair to say. Um, some people have reacted to the piece by, you know, acting as if I'm saying women cause all the problems in the world. I'm definitely not saying that, but I am saying that feminization has caused one specific particular problem, and that is wokeness. Like a lot of people, I was baffled by the woke phenomenon. Why did everyone seemingly go crazy all at once in the summer of 2020? It was inexplicable. It seemed to be mass hysteria, genuinely. And the more I thought about uh what caused it um which is a very important question because if we know what causes it we know how to prevent it from happening in the future. Uh I read an article that someone else wrote that put forward a really simple elegant thesis which is that wokeness is simply feminine patterns of behavior applied to institutions where women had not been very well represented until recently. Um, women tend to be more consensus focused, consensusoriented. Uh, men when they're approaching a moral question will ask what are the facts? What are the rules? Whereas women will say what are the relationships at play here? How can we make everybody happy? How can we reach an outcome that will satisfy all the parties as opposed to the male perspective of how do we reach an outcome that is just and according to the rules? That sounded a lot like wokeness to me. And the um sort of piece that made it all click into place for me was the coincidence of timing. It is the case just we can all agree as as a matter of fact that a lot of institutions that went woke or were affected by wokeness became demographically female in the last 5 years. Law schools in America turned majority female in 2016 and they've gotten a little bit more female every year since then. I think now it stands at 55 56%. The New York Times became majority female in its workforce in 2018, which is maybe why it was so susceptible to the fads of wokeness and the internal policing and the slack revolts that took place uh internally over there. Uh medical schools are now majority female. The white collar workforce overall employees in the United States with college degrees, a majority of them are women. uh and managers management positions uh in the US workforce 46% female so almost majority female. So the fact that all of these institutions tipped over to being majority female around the same time that wokeness emerged seemed to me that couldn't possibly be a coincidence. >> And um there's so many questions within that. I guess the first stress test of this argument would be well they were also very close to being majority female 10 years prior to that, right? So does does going from 48 to 52% does that is that really such a major shift that it would cause something as dramatic as that? >> Well, you'd be surprised. I thought that the higher education workforce professors uh in the United States would have gone female ages and ages ago. Um but it actually only took female in 2023. Um, so we think of feminization as something that happened a long time ago, but it really does take a certain amount of time for time to pass and older generations to retire. Um, but I think the uh reason why attaining a critical mass of women has such a dramatic effect is that we're not talking about individual differences, differences between individual men and individual women, but differences in group dynamics. Um, for example, you you might be able to say from a from the perspective of psychology as a discipline that women tend to be more emotional than men and men tend to be more rational or well any kind of generalization about men and women might have a certain amount of empirical support based on surveys. But at the end of the day, those differences are not massive, right? like female support for free speech uh is greater or is less than male by double digits but not you know it's not like night and day. But when it comes to group dynamics, how does an organization function? How does an institution deal with conflict? When you're talking about those kinds of things, those tend to be more binary. Like either you solve your conflicts within an organization in a masculine way or in a feminine way. either open conflict is something that your institution will tolerate or it's not. So that's the kind of thing where once you get a critical mass, you really kind of have to pick which one you're going to do. >> Well, you mentioned consensus and sort of empathy and including all perspectives. That really isn't what happened with wokeness, though, is it? Because it was more like we've come to a new consensus and anyone who doesn't agree is going to get killed basically. Is is that really I mean that that might be the way women deal with this on a group basis. I don't know. You tell me. No, it's it's it's hard to verbalize some of these differences because you you know it it might be a convenient shortorthhand to say men are more comfortable with conflict than women. I think that that makes a lot of sense, right? But uh a a famous psychology study, uh very often if you're studying gender differences, you'll and you're a psychologist, the way you'll do your study is you'll just go to a playground and watch the kids playing and observe and count up how many times somebody hits somebody else or something like that. Uh and there was an experiment of that type done I believe in Scandinavia and it had a really funny uh outcome. They uh the psychologists observed the kids playing and counted up how many fights they had and they said okay we observe that the men fight a lot more than the girls. But then as a supplement they decided to confirm their observations by talking to the kids and saying how many fights did you have today Billy or how many fights did you have today Sally? And it was their discrepancy was huge. They found that the girls reported having just as many fights as the men. Um the level of conflict uh male and female on that schoolyard was exactly the same. But their observations had failed to record any of the female conflicts because when they asked the girls, \"Oh, you had a fight today. What did that entail?\" It was things like Megan said she was going to tell everybody they couldn't be my friend anymore, >> which is where words of violence comes from the I imagine your argument. >> That's right. That's right. And and one of the most consistent psychological differences between men and women is women have a strong uh impulse of caring, right? Which is exactly I mean I I'm not somebody who looks to evolutionary biology for the solutions to all human phenomena, but this particular one does seem glaringly Darwinian, right? that women see helpless things and they want to take care of them. That is definitely something that Darwin would find a pretty easy explanation for. But that's also something that wokeness can easily weaponize. It means that if you can frame your political issue as a way of caring for some helpless class, then you're golden. Right. You >> Minorities are babies. >> That's right. And but that is that is precisely what's going on at at a at a deeper level. And that's why it's been so effective. >> And Helen, your article, and I encourage everyone to read it. It's fascinating whether you agree or disagree with it. But you cited one particular case, which is the former president of Harvard. So, let's talk about that because you use it as an as the main example for the thrust of your argument. >> That's right. This was back in 2005. So, this is before anybody had ever heard of wokeness. Now, uh, I don't know if your listeners in the UK will be familiar with Larry Summers, but he was at that time probably one of the 10 most powerful people in the country. He was not just the president of Harvard. He had also been in Bill Clinton's cabinet. He had been at the World Bank. He was an academically eminent economist, very well-connected in the Democratic party. Just a really powerful guy. He was invited to give a speech at a conference on female under reppresentation in science and math and he decided to deliver his remarks off the cuff and to be really and actually if you know anything about Larry Summers he he has a reputation for being a really blunt guy. He's somebody who does not suffer fools gladly. So when when you're getting the blunt Larry Summers, you're really getting something quite direct. But the talk was supposed to be off the record and that's important to emphasize that the the women who listened to what he said and took it to a reporter were violating the rules that they had undertaken to follow when they attended. Anyway, he said that female underrepresentation in the hard sciences was attributable to a lot of different factors, not necessarily just prejudice or bias or the patriarchy not thinking ladies can be science scientists. there is a difference of aptitude at the very very very high ends. If you're talking about people who are going to be tenured at MIT, that's the way out at the end of the bell curve and there tend to be more men out there than women. Uh and also differences in taste. That is women tend to gravitate towards uh professions and fields where they get to deal with people as opposed to something really cold and abstract like physics. Not to say that no women do, but that is the tendency. So women who are way out there at that end of the bell curve and have the aptitude for a career in hard science would maybe gravitate to something like medicine as opposed to something like physics. So, so Larry Summer said all this and there were a bunch of lady scientists in the audience who said, \"How dare you?\" And they gave quotes to a reporter something like, \"I felt like I was going to throw up or I thought I was going to black out.\" And it became a and it became a huge controversy. And uh there were a lot of other controversies during Larry Summers's tenure as president of Harvard. So that was not the only thing that brought him down, but it was definitely at the very top of the list. And about a year later, he resigned. And what's really interesting is with that case, and now I don't doubt that it caused a massive stir when he went on and basically went, I'm going to freestyle and deliver truth bombs to all of you. So here you are. Enjoy it. But he's also, if you get to be president of Harvard, you are going to make enemies a plenty. In order to get to that position, you're going to have to fire people, antagonize people, because that's just the nature of the job. So he would have had loads of enemies who were willing just to pounce at that particular moment. Surely. >> Mhm. Yeah. And and I I I'm trying to remember some of the other controversies that have attended Larry Summers's career. And I believe one from his tenure at the World Bank was when he said, \"Are we sure we want to really really enforce labor laws against having sweat shops in third world countries? Because isn't having sweat shops good for them sometimes? I mean it leads to economic development. He he fra phrased it in a really blunt way. So like this is a guy who has a history of putting his foot in his mouth in a way that I frankly find really admirable. >> Yeah. [laughter] >> But certain people don't. So you then so then that has that been extrapolated right the way through society essentially is your argument >> that that was one of the first times that a cancellation uh happened that people heard somebody say something offensive pitched a little fit and managed to rob this person of his job. And the particular aspect of it that seemed so full of foreoding looking back is that there was no attempt to debate the issue rationally. There were plenty of people, even people on the Harvard faculty with eminent expertise in the relevant scientific fields, willing to stand up and say everything Larry Summers said was perfectly within the scientific mainstream. Greater male variability hypo that's, you know, everybody thinks that. Um, so there were people willing to say he's right on the facts. Uh, criticize him all you want for his tone, but he was right on the facts. And the women who went after his job were not willing to have that debate. They were not willing to talk about it rationally. They just said, \"I'm offended. I felt like I was going to black out. He was invalidating my career. This is, you know, everything I worked for.\" Um, very much a feelings over facts kind of thing. And so, I I don't mind if there are people who are feminists or who have different political views to those that I have. But it's important that we be able to debate them, right? That we have rational arguments. And this was one of the first instances where people just said, \"No, I'm not going to I'm not going to debate it. I'm just going to say I'm offended and that's going to be the end of the story. >> Because Jordan Peterson used to talk a lot about this where he used to talk about one of the ways that females try and destroy or attack other people isn't through the physical realm. It's through reputation destruction. And this is essentially what you're talking about, isn't it? >> Mhm. Yeah. Absolutely. >> This episode of Trigonometry is brought to you by Next Insurance.

And one of the other things I don't know if um I hope I'm not revealing anything that I shouldn't in terms of because I don't I can't remember if this is something I heard Jordan say publicly or privately, but I don't think you'd mind me sharing this. I mean one of the things she talked to me about was the fact that the the female mind sort of has three categories for other human beings. One of them is baby i.e. infant needs care. Another one is caregiver i.e. spouse you know mother-in-law etc. And then it sort of kind of makes sense to treat everybody else as a potential enemy just from a safety perspective. Well, you don't know them, so you might as well make sure that you are extra careful. And what you do with the enemy, if you establish that they're the enemy, is you get away. And if you can't, you destroy them somehow, right? Um and if if we accept your thesis which is minor women and minorities are fit the infant category then anyone who appears to in any way be not on board with eternal empowerment let's call it that they would automatically go in the enemy box >> and then what happens is what happens to Larry. >> Yeah I I like Jordan Peterson a I think he's a very wise person, but to be to be honest, this uh sort of mythology of gender differences was never something that interested me. It was never a topic that I ever anticipated I would be writing about. It's just not not my cup of tea. Um because it seems like a kind of debate that goes in circles and has gone in circles for centuries. There have been battles between the male and the female since the dawn of time. uh since before the dawn of time uh the primates there are battles between men and women. It's definitely a topic of debate that has been returned to and recycled over the centuries. The reason why this feminization thesis kind of sparked my interest in a way that gender dynamics in general never really did is that it is something unprecedented. It is that miraculous thing, something in the gender wars that is truly new. We have never, no civilization on the planet has ever had a situation where they can look forward to a day when a majority of judges are going to be female. Um, or they can anticipate a day not too long from now when the majority of legislators in their parliament are going to be female. When they have female police chiefs in their largest cities or, you know, the the legal profession in general is on its way to being majority female. That is something unprecedented. So, it's really not that surprising and shouldn't really be that controversial to say that something no civilization in human history has ever faced is posing new problems that we haven't seen before. >> And how do you frame this in your mind? Are you are you saying well look we're rebalancing society and as a result of this we will have institutions and discourse and a way of doing politics and a way of doing many things that is more female and you know we're rebalancing society and that's great or that that like any change that causes problems but it also brings benefits or is your contention that the increasing feminization of institutions is in and of itself a negative because that way of doing things is less suited to the purpose of those institutions because those are very different perspectives. >> That's right. It's all about the purpose of the institution. So you have to judge it on a case-by case basis. The most feminized profession in America today is veterinary medicine. All of the veterinarians in America are ladies now. I don't know why that happened, but 80% of students at [clears throat] veterinary schools are women. Now, uh I it's possible that that has had catastrophic effects that I'm not aware of, but [laughter] I'm pretty comfortable with that. I don't I don't think that's going to lead to the end of civilization because there's nothing about feminine modes of interaction that is contrary to the essence of veterinary medicine. Uh however, I think if you're a university, that might be one where if you have modes of group interaction that are oriented towards conformity and consensus, that's not compatible with what a university is supposed to do. A university is supposed to be a safe place for prickly eccentric characters who believe things that nobody else believes because they've studied an issue really hard and they're, you know, disagreeable. That's the university should be a place for them. And if you're now running your English department in a way that you no longer tolerate characters of that description, that seems like a problem. Uh, in the case of business, that's one where I can imagine some businesses where feminine modes of interaction would be an advantage and would lead your business to flourish. I can imagine other businesses where the HRification of the workplace is a major roadblock and makes it really hard for your business to do the things it was designed to do. So, in my perfect world, there would be room for both. We would, you know, it's a it's a big world out there. Everybody can find the kind of workplace that is most compatible with their own preferences. The problem is that in the United States right now, there are a lot of um legal thumbs on the scale that tend to really really empower the HR lady in your office and give her a veto power of everything that anybody does uh who works at your company. And that has led to a feminization of every workplace, every large institution in America. So, I think that is a thumb on the scale that makes it hard for institutions that might be more suited to masculine modes of interaction to pursue them. So, yeah, and it has to be judged on a case- by case basis. There are examples of feminization that are fine. There are examples of feminization that are advantageous. Um, so you just have to judge it against what it whether or not it serves the purpose of the institution and also whether or not that feminization was naturally occurring or whether it was just the HR lady coming in and uh ruining things for everybody. >> Well, in in terms of the HR lady thing, I totally get what you're saying on the one hand. I also think look, I'm 42 years old. Within my lifetime, there would have been male bosses who would glow around slapping their secretaries on the ass. And that was the culture of and that business, you know, you might say, well, you know, that business made more money and it was much more concerned about, you know, profits and it didn't care about, you know, somebody had the wrong opinion and people weren't getting cancelled. But maybe that was a good thing to address. >> Yeah. No, absolutely. I I think sexual harassment is very bad. Good. Good. [laughter] Good that we have laws against it. Um, but I I think the uh some of the reaction to the article I wrote that was negative came from people who just really don't know what the law mandates today. People out there who read it did not believe me when I said that you can be sued for not hiring [snorts] enough women at your company and for not promoting enough women at your company. But that is that is truly the case. Um, one of the most famous gender discrimination lawsuits in uh, American history was the Sears case, which was launched by the Equal uh, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1980 against Sears, the big retailer. Specifically, they alleged that Sears was channeling women into non-commission sales positions and away from the commission sales positions, which tended to be more irregularly remunerated um, because it's a commission sales position. And so you had good months and bad months, but you genuinely generally got higher pay. Uh Sears responded to this lawsuit by saying, \"Look, the statistical disparity is there. You're right. Our female employees tend to prefer um lower paying but more stable uh remuneration packages. We've tried to get them interested in this one and they just won't do it.\" But the EEOC said, \"No, it's only because you are biased against women that you have this statistical disparity.\" And the thing that makes the Sears case so famous in the annals of these lawsuits is that their case was entirely statistical, purely statistical. They did not have a single woman who claimed to have been discriminated against at Sears. All the women that Sears called said, \"We love it. We love this company. They're really great. They're a great place for a woman to work. Now, eventually after six years, a judge ruled in Sears's favor. So, Sears won that case. The EEOC did not prevail in their purely statistical uh case, but it took Sears a lot of money to defend against that lawsuit. It did drag on for six years. It was not like they said to them on day one, if you don't have a client, you don't have a case. Um and the way that the law resolved this um question of whether you could have a purely statistical case was to say it can't be just statistics. You do need somebody who claims to have been discriminated against, but it can be primarily statistical. So it it is simply true that if your company has men over represented in management or in employees overall, that can be the basis for some woman to come along and file a lawsuit against you. And that has occurred in many many businesses. and it usually doesn't make the headlines, so people don't really know that that's what the law says, but Wall Street firms have been hit with things like this because they don't have enough female traders. Um, it just if you're a business owner, you have to be aware of this. And so, I think it is true. It is just a fact as a matter of of of fact about the world that women are hired and promoted more than they would be in a pure meritocracy because of laws like that. Because it always interested me with the whole kind of woke thing and when we went peak nonsense that and more people within the halls of power, wherever that may be, whether it be politics, business, or wherever else, go, \"No, you're not going to have a glorified tantrum.\" And I always saw it as a courage deficit if I'm being honest. But now that you've explained there's a legal element to it, it goes some way to explaining part of the problem. Well, think about uh James Daymore, the guy at Google who wrote his memo saying basically the same Larry Summers argument all over again. The reason why Google fired him was not just because they had a staff revolt. It was because it made them vulnerable to a lawsuit. If you have somebody who's on the record saying, \"I think it's possible that women are underrepresented at the extremes of aptitude.\" uh then somebody who files a lawsuit can say he doesn't think women can be capable and that's why he didn't promote me or hire me or give me opportunities at work. So yeah know that there have that is not the only case where that has happened that somebody has made a statement about gender differences that led their institution to fire them because they were worried about legal liability. >> But that seems to me so ridiculous because it's a clear misrepresentation of the argument. Even you know when I used to teach you I could do you know I could show that to my 14 or 15 year olds and go why does that argument not scan and they'd be able to explain it. So why can't other people? >> I I don't know what to tell you. It's the trouble is that the the law is just the the simple 1964 civil rights law. You can't discriminate against somebody on the basis of sex. And that sounds really great. I mean that that you know the same way that the ERRA sounded really great. Equal Rights Amendment was against equal rights, but judges have extrapolated from that really simple statement all kinds of stuff and it has created an atmosphere of uncertainty, right? So, and that that's the thing that is most oppressive that feels most totalitarian on a day-to-day basis. You really never know whether some behavior or some statement is against the law or not because a lot of stuff falls into the gray area of well it's not technically illegal but if somebody sued our company they might be able to cite that as evidence of a atmosphere of bias. Um, and that's just not the way law is supposed to work. >> Because what it seems to be is, look, let's be honest about this. Until relatively recently, women had a pretty tough time of it. It wasn't it wasn't, you know, easy to be a woman, particularly not in the workplace. You were likely to be discriminated against. There's case after case, story after story. What it seems to me is that there has been an overcorrection by well-meaning people wanting to implement laws in order to protect women and it's kind of metastasized into something else. >> And we have to keep in mind it's not just about the people who work at an institution. If you're talking about something like the legal system, I I want female lawyers to be happy and have a good time, but that is not my top priority. My top priority is that we have a good legal system that's functioning and leads to a just and fair society. And we had uh increasing female representation in the legal system seems to have been accompanied by a lot more wokeness, which I think is more damaging in lawyers than it is in almost anywhere else. because the law is the one field where you really want people to be as literal-minded as possible, as devoted to the rules as possible, not fudging things so that everybody's happy, really sticking to the letter of the law. Um, and and so if the law is corrupted, that's something that I'm very very worried about. And we saw we got a glimpse of what a maximally feminized legal system might look like here in the United States in our Title 9 campus courts for sexual assault. Uh I don't know how it's done in the UK, but here in the US in 2011, the Obama administration mandated that universities in the United States adopt certain rules for adjudicating allegations of sexual assault on campus. things like you had to use a preponderance of evidence standard. So, no more proving things beyond a reasonable doubt. Um, men who were accused were no longer allowed to confront their accusers because that might be traumatizing. It was just basically the the wish list that we saw during the me too era which you know a lot of people were sympathetic to because nobody wants you know sexual abuse or sexual assault or anything like that. But on the other hand, you also want these legal protections and due process protections that have evolved over centuries for very good reasons. And what we saw in the Title 9 campus courts for sexual assault and what we saw during the Me Too movement was a willingness to throw out those due process protections because of a political commitment to feminist values. And so I I don't want to see that attitude to the law expand to other fields cuz in the particular case of sexual assault and me too. It worked out really really badly. A lot of people were unfairly accused and had their lives ruined and it was it was not a good system. When [snorts] you buy seafood, what do you worry about most? Nutrition, sustainability, taste. I've asked all of those questions. This is why Wild Alaskan Company caught my attention. It is the best way to get wild caught, perfectly portioned, nutrient-dense seafood delivered to your door. You've not tasted fish this good. When we first got a delivery from Wild Alaskan company, it stood out immediately. The care that goes into it, the packaging, the clear sourcing, their attention to detail. You can tell this is a company that does things properly. What makes Wild Alaskan Company special is how they source everything. 100% wild core, never farmed. No antibiotics, no GMOs, no additives, just clean real fish frozen off the boat to lock in flavor and nutrients like omega-3s. You get flexible shipments, expert cooking tips, and a box that genuinely feels like it's come from people who care about what they're sending. My favorite variety is their Pacific Halibur. Firm and meaty, it cooks beautifully in a pan or on the grill and goes with almost anything. And there's no risk. If you're not completely satisfied with your first box, Wild Alaskan Company gives you a full refund, no questions asked. Get seafood you can trust. Go to wildalaskan.com/trigg for $35 off your first box of premium wildcourt seafood. That's wildlaskan.com/trigg for $35 off your first order. Thanks to Wild Alaskan company for sponsoring this episode. >> I completely agree with you. I mean, and there's many cases. Let's not get into that. But you said campus courts and as somebody who was brought up, we were both brought up in the UK, uh, and we went to university in the UK, etc. I've never heard of a campus court. >> That immediately rings alarm bells. Why is there a campus court? What is this? >> That's right. You would think, um, women who had some bad sexual experience, like a hookup that went wrong or any anything like that could then go to their university and say, I, you know, that guy raped me, or whatever. Um, and then the school would be in charge of discipline or adjudicating that case. Um, now you or I might think that if you've been the victim of a serious assault, you would go to the police and that I think is what a lot of people um recommend as a better system. But the school uh was required to have its own little campus courts for deciding whether or not a particular hookup had met the standard for assault. Um and yeah, it was a really bad system and a lot of people had their lives ruined. >> Well, uh coming back a little bit to your point about women being promoted partly because there's a fear of not having enough women in your company or institution. Do you not think that this ultimately goes back to the very core of the main idea that you must never utter out loud in public now in pretty much anywhere in the western world is that there are group differences between people not just men and women but generally that maybe some groups are over represented or under reppresented in certain fields because of cultural differences or maybe god forbid genetic differences or other things. Uh Thomas Soul has a great bit in his last in his last book about how almost every brewery in the world including Ting Tao the Chinese brewery was founded by Germans right he he breaks down the you know how in almost every great American Latinos are more over represented in baseball white people are over represented in hockey black people over represented in the NBA like it's actually the standard human thing that different people have different aptitudes for different things. But if you live in a society whose central idea is that all men are created the same, not equal, but the same, which is what we now believe, then all of this stuff follows surely. >> Yeah. Uh I I think a lot of the research into group differences is really valuable. But one question that they don't have an answer to and that no one has an answer to is one that I think we're on the on the cusp of finding out. and that is how big of an effect have affirmative action programs had? Um when the SFFA group filed its lawsuit against Harvard and eventually prevailed at the Supreme Court um and got got their Supreme Court ruling saying that Harvard may no longer use race as a factor in college admissions when that lawsuit was ongoing. This is amazing. Nobody had an answer to the question of if you get rid of racial preferences at Harvard, will the black proportion of the freshman class go from 14% to 10%. Or will it go from 14% to 2%. Um, I mean, you can make rough estimates of this based on things like test scores and grades, but people genuinely didn't know. Um, and uh, we're we're sort of seeing that play out now on various college campuses what the effects will be. But it was amazing to think that they got rid of affirmative action in university admissions without knowing what the outcome would be. When it comes to things like the workforce, these programs uh for women uh and for other groups have been in place for so long now for for decades really that just like with the SFA case, nobody knows what would happen if you got rid of them. Um, President Trump has gotten rid of a lot of DEI programs since, you know, the start of the year, uh, since the start of term two, and we are just going to have to wait and see what effect that will have on the US workforce. It is way too early to tell, but there have been news stories in places like the Associated Press showing that I think the latest count is 350,000 black women have become unemployed or left the workforce since the start of the year, which is a pretty big number. And black unemployment is going up now, even though white unemployment is stable or down. So, those two are diverging in a way that they usually don't. Now, it is way too early to attribute either of those developments to the end of DEI. Um, it is definitely way too early to say anything like that or or to even come to any conclusions at all. But these affirmative action programs have been around for so long that nobody really knows what would happen if you got rid of them. So, we don't really know what Trump's anti-Dei steps, what effect that will have on the American workforce. Now to bring it back to feminization, it is my prediction that if you got rid of these thumbs on the scale that the problem of the great feminization would take care of itself. Um that the demographics of a lot of these institutions would change uh in a way that um basically the problem would solve itself. Now there are some people who disagree, some people who think uh the great feminization is here to stay. Uh, I'm willing to kind of see what happens. Um, I think there are probably some forms of the great feminization that are here to stay. Uh, women earn more bachelor's degrees than men. There are more female undergraduates than male. Uh, but that's been the case since the 1980s. I think the female advantage in post-secary education, that's probably pretty resilient. I would expect that to continue to be the case. In fact, at a lot of universities, they have affirmative action for men because they don't get enough male applicants and they know if they have a 70% female campus, nobody's going to want to go there. Um, so at the undergraduate level, it's men who enjoy affirmative action. But how would that work out in the workforce? Uh, I would anticipate that, um, uh, a lot of the feminization that we see now would naturally recede. But, uh, as I've said, nobody really knows. And Helen, how much of this is to do with young women not having kids and therefore their empathy has to go somewhere? It's a controversial question because we know that women as they have kids, they become more conservative, their priorities change, they focus more on family than they do on social issues. I have certainly met liberal women who whom I would be bold be so bold as to psychoanalyze that that is exactly what is going on. Um but I think the great feminization the channeling of so many women of childbearing age into the workforce has had two really big potentially civilization ending consequences. One is the one I've been talking about which is the feminization of institutions that makes them no longer function well. The other is declining birth rates that if you have too many women too dedicated to their careers or engaged in other activities and so that they're not having kids that too can cause the end of your civilization. So it it's you know but I feel like there are a lot of people uh working on the birth rate stuff. Um but I it's not a coincidence I guess is what I'm trying to say that these two problems have arisen at the same time because they are both connected to the same phenomenon. It is a phenomenon that like I said before is one that no human civilization in history has ever faced. So it's not surprising that it would yield um huge unprecedented problems. I think the falling birth rate is one of them. Well, and also as well, you know, we have to look at universities when it comes to this because there's a lot of women who go into university and men and they effectively serve as indoctrination camps. I have friends and I know people who went to Ivy League universities in this country and what they tell me about the first couple of weeks, I'm I'm going like this isn't a place of education. You know, you have to stand up and say how you've been oppressed. And that is one very prestigious university in this country where everybody in a class stood up and had to identify how they are oppressed and why it affected them. And you're going, \"What has this got to do with psychology?\" >> Oh, yeah. You don't have to tell me. The first really famous woke video of the girl yelling at her college master in the courtyard because of the Halloween email. Like the the master's wife had sent out an email saying, \"Everybody, Halloween is coming up. Let's be chill about cultural appropriation. If you see a white girl wearing a sorryari, don't freak out. And a bunch of people said that's really offensive. >> Bunch of people freaked out. [laughter] >> Um and it it culminated in a screaming match cuz the master of the college told people to, you know, come out and let's let's talk. Let's talk it over. And one girl just had a shrieking meltdown. Dropped a lot of fbombs, which I think is not appropriate to do in that situation. exception is because other people have rights too, not just walk away to create an unsafe space here for all. Be quiet >> for all Silman students. You understand that as your position of master, it is your job to create a place of comfort and home for the students that live in Silon. You have not done that. By sending out that email, that goes against your position as master. Do you understand that? No, I don't agree with that. >> Then then why the [ __ ] did you accept THE POSITION? >> WHO THE [ __ ] HIRED YOU? >> I have a different vision. >> YOU SHOULD STEP DOWN. IF THAT IS WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT BEING a master, you should step down. It is not about creating an intellectual space. It is not. Do you understand that? It's about creating a home here. >> You are not doing that. >> You're supposed TO BE OUR ADVOCATE. YOU SHOULD BE A MID EVENT less when you hear a fro say that she doesn't know how to create a safe page for a freshman in filament. >> How do you explain that? These freshmen come here and they think this is what Yale is. >> Do you hear that? They're going to leave. They're going to transfer because you are a poor student community. >> You should not sleep at night. >> We're out. We out. >> You're disgusting. But the reason why that video stuck in my mind uh was not just that it was one of the first sort of inaugural salvos of the woke era, but because you could see my old college room in the background. I was like, [clears throat] I walked across that courtyard. That's my courtyard. Stop desecrating it. >> No, took it personally. >> Yeah. No, absolutely. But I also feel like, you know, we talk about feminization. We really have to look at the universities because if you pump this doctrine, this ideology into people's heads and then they go out and then spread the ideology. You you have to take responsibility. We need to look at universities. >> Helen, you're pulling faces. Destroy him with facts and logic. [laughter] >> No in a more masculine way. Don't care about consensus or his feelings. >> I feel that that No. Um the the the reason why I disagree is that I I don't think wokeness is an ideology. And and the reason why it's important um to emphasize that is because if it's an ideology, the way we get rid of it is by having better arguments. But if wokeness is an inevitable result of demographic feminization, if any or organization or institution that has a critical mass of women is going to behave this way no matter what their ideology is. If that's the case, then we really can't trust that wokeness is over or will recede naturally or that better arguments will win the day. And I see a lot of people now feel like, okay, the the insanity of 2020 is over. People are no longer getting canceled left and right. Maybe the vibe shift is here and wokeness is over. Um, and I I think that is premature. I think it is it is going to be more resilient than that because it does it is connected to this demographic feminization. >> Well, very much on that. I mean, I I nearly made the joke that, you know, you're saying we shouldn't get rid of the ideology. We should just get rid of the women. But I guess what I'm going to ask you is once you've got the situation where you've encouraged so many women into the workplace, your argument is you've affirmative actioned them somewhat into the workplace. We now live in a society where even as a twoinome couple, life is pretty hard actually in a way that it just wasn't for your grandparents in this country. Are you gonna get the toothpaste back in the tube? Like, how do you how do you even do that? Because as a young woman, uh you you you're not going to get married until your mid-30s, possibly just because of the way the world is. You need to make a living. You need to have a career. It's no longer as much of an option to to m to find a guy at 20, marry, be the homemaker, and let him cuz like that guy is going to have to earn a hell of a lot of money just for you to live a lower class in life. forget about a middle class life, right? >> The two income trap is a serious problem. >> Yeah. >> Um and I think there are a lot of things unrelated to the gender question that we can do to address that. Uh I think that uh reducing immigration would actually go a really long way to solving the two-inccome trap uh and reducing some of those massive cost of living pressures that couples face. But I have hope. I'm optimistic that the two income trap problem can be solved uh through appropriate policies because there are just so many forces of gravity pulling against it. >> Even now when it's you there are so many pressures for women to stay in the workforce even when they have kids. Even even with all of those things, most women still tell surveys that they prefer to work part-time or to drop out of the workforce for a few years while their kids are young. So, that's what women still want. And the women whose husbands do earn enough tend to do exactly that. even really accomplished women uh women with law degrees or medical degrees almost most of them go part-time at some point in their careers when they choose to have children. So there there really are a lot of deeply seated human forces of gravity pulling in the direction of the mode of of of family that we've had um for millennia. So the two income trap does make it harder, but I think if we make it even just a little bit easier, people will gravitate uh to the older better model. >> That's really interesting. The one area of your So all of the things we've talked about so far, you're an expert in and we're not. The one area that you talked about that we sort of do know from the inside out is media. And that's where I thought with with all possible respect of course that there was the most controversial claims that you made actually because one of the arguments you made is uh and you you've kind of described it already in the course of this conversation which is about the fact that a more male institution is much more focused on the pursuit of truth even if that means there's conflict people are offended and upset >> and I go well look at the kind of world that we're in we're in new media we're on YouTube we're in podcasting thing almost all of the people who do that are male. I go I'm not certain that that is become an environment where the pursuit of truth is the primary goal. Uh it seems to me that the pursuit of clicks, the pursuit of controversy, the pursuit of the fighting is become the primary goal. Pursue of truth seems to me quite secondary. So, is it really true to say that, you know, the more masculineized institutions of media are much more focused on truth than the more feminized version of it? [snorts] The news doesn't just tell you what's happening. It so often tells you what to think is happening. And these days, the biggest red flag isn't what's said, it's what gets left out. That's why I use Ground News. It's the only site and app that compares coverage from across the political spectrum and highlights which stories are being ignored entirely. See for yourself at ground.news/trigonometry. Their blind spot feed is one of my favorite features. It surfaces around 20 stories a day that are being overlooked by either the left or the right. It's a simple but powerful way to track media bias in real time. Like this. NIH scientists recently published a declaration criticizing Trump's cuts to public health research. That's a major move. And yet only 2% of the coverage came from right-leaning outlets. A new study found that 2024 saw the most armed conflicts globally since 1946. A staggering statistics, but you would have missed it if you'd only read left-wing news sources. Ground News gives you the full picture. headlines, ownership, bias ratings, and context so you can actually understand what's going on, not just react to what you're told. Head to ground.news/trigonometry for 40% off their unlimited advantage plan, the same one we use, and start thinking for yourself. >> I think one of the best responses to the article that I read was by Megan Mardle, who's a political journalist in Washington, DC, who I've been reading for a long time. She's really, really great, really sharp. uh [clears throat] but she reflected on the feminization thesis and thought well you know certainly there's clearly a lot of validity there but the part that I liked was her anecdote of her own career in media she said you know that she's been to policy dinners in DC where journalists and practitioners get together and she's been to the some all female ones deliberately all female you know to help the ladies advance their careers and she says the atmosphere is so different because at those all female dinners, when you ask somebody a question, you do that with the purpose of getting an answer and hearing what it is. If you're at a mixed policy dinner where men are present, you ask a question to prove that you're smarter than the person you're asking the question of. >> And so, it's it is clearly true that I I do not mean to lionize or paint a rosy picture of masculine modes of interaction. They are certainly not always oriented towards the pursuit of truth. But our institutions have evolved to turn male stupidity and competitiveness and silliness. I have three boys. I deal with it a lot. Um to turn that into uh to channel that towards the pursuit of truth. So even if you are at one of the mixed policy dinners that Megan Ricardo was talking about and it's a lot of people trying to show that they're smarter than the other people at the end of the table, everybody else in the room learns a lot. you know, the the fact that you're trying to do that kind of one-upsmanship tends to lead to a good conversation and and to advance certainly with greater solarity than the all female policy dinners, which I have also been at, which do tend to move really slow because there's a lot of compliments and telling each other how great they are, but nothing against it. It's I'd love I love compliments, but you know, it's it does take up a lot of time, >> you know, and what [laughter] Well, moving on. >> No, hold on, hold on, hold on. Sorry. Sorry to interrupt, but can we come back to this point about media? Because the the broadcast scene, I just genuinely don't think with all respect or our our fellow YouTubers and podcasters has created an environment that is more focused on the pursuit of truth. And that to me is kind of the big issue with the argument you're making. Do you have any more to say on that aspect of it? I mean, I'm I'm not sure that the purpose of a podcast is always just the pursuit of truth, right? At a at a certain level, it's also about entertainment. It's also about growing your audience. You know, I' I've worked at a lot of publications where you have meetings and sit down and ask basic questions like what is our purpose? And truth is a a part of it and and one that you always want to keep front and center, but I'm not sure it's the only thing. But I guess the my my real response is that there are definitely masculine modes of failure as well. So it is it is very possible for institutions to fail in masculine distinctively masculine ways that they would not have failed if there had been more ladies in the room. >> But when I look at the world around me today, I don't see a lot of institutions failing in that way. I do see a lot of institutions failing in distinctly feminine ways. And would you say particularly a good example of this might be something like Disney for instance where they produ, you know, you produce content that shall we say is hyper liberal, progressive, woke, whatever way you want to describe it. No one wants to watch it and is everybody's like, why is there a trans person in my Star Wars movie? >> Yeah. And and and it doesn't even have sort of masculine coded stories of adventure and and and things like that. Because to me, the thing that I found surprising as somebody who loves movies, loves series, not particularly huge Star Wars fan. What I couldn't understand is again and again, why are you producing content that the hardcore of your fan base won't like? That to me seems like glorified economic financial suicide. >> I'm not a Star Wars fan, but I have heard that I have heard that feedback from people I know who do love Star Wars. It's a it's a boy franchise. Why are you making the girl a girl movie in your boy franchise? That doesn't make any sense. Yeah, I don't know. >> Right. So, but it isn't just Star Wars. But I guess the the the thing that I kind of wanted to drill down upon is we've talked about the peak of woke. Do you think that we've now coming to the end of it or do you think that it will always remain there latent because of this feminization process that you've described? Yeah, I'm I'm worried that it will it will still be there. Um that it it's only a matter of time before somebody whips up another um moral outrage that we all have to be hysterical about because the the way that we neutralize those kinds of mass hysteria episodes is by talking about them rationally. And if we don't do that anymore, then we're not going to be able to neutralize them. But it's also as well and Constantin touched on it with his argument about with the podcast scene which is basically people respond to incentives. Social media also rewards people who make histrionic overblown ridiculous arguments because they create the most engagement. >> Yeah. Yeah. And I'm worried about that. And I think there are things we can do in the meantime, right? Like I think universities today are very feminized. I think that is maybe a long-term threat to their viability as institutions of the pursuit of truth, but we're not going to turn that ship around in the next 5 years. So, what can we do in the immediate future? Uh, I think interim steps are always a good idea. You can have uh statements of academic freedom. You know, I I I think definitely schools should try and put those in place now so that the next time wokeness rolls around, we have tools in place to shut it down, but I think that as long as institutions remain feminized, you're still going to have the the threat will still be there. And your uh treatment plan would be to end affirmative action and retain the idea that we shouldn't discriminate against people, but assess that on the basis of whether someone's actually been discriminated against as opposed to the number of women you have at your company. >> That's right. Although in some cases that might not be sufficient medicine, I think one of the most compelling pieces of evidence to me that the great feminization is not entirely natural. It's not just a product of women have had now had a chance to compete and it turns out they're better at everything. You know, it's not just a natural result of women out competing men, which is something that a lot of feminists say, right? They say, \"Well, why is your newsroom full of ladies? Because ladies are great journalists. I don't know what to tell you.\" Um the the piece of evidence that persuaded me that that's not what's going on is the way institutions tend to become more and more feminized with the passage of time. If it were just a matter of women out competing men, you would expect institutions to reach 50/50 gender par and then roughly stay there. Um if you assume that talent is equally distributed. But instead, we see that institutions that reach 50% women tend to then become 52, 55, 56. Uh the one institution that's way far out at the end of that process is psychology. The field of psychology. Threearters of graduate students in psychology now are women. It is an extremely feminized field. And we see that over and over in other institutions as well, although usually not so far advanced. Uh as fields become feminized, what it looks like to me is they become distinctly unwelcoming to men. Because if you're a man and you're interested in psychology, maybe you're interested in particular branches of psychology that tend to appeal to the male male mind more like neurossychology, the hard science stuff, whatever. But then you show up in your psychology department and it's a bunch of women and they are not interested in the same aspects of psychology that you are. They're not willing to debate with you in the way that you think academic debate should be conducted. You just find the whole atmosphere really, really feminized and you think, do I really want to spend my career here? I don't think I do. or if you I I honestly can't imagine what it would have been like to be a male New York Times reporter during Peak Woke. Like we all caught a glimpse of the internal workings of that institution during the Barry Weiss saga when they bullied her out of her job. But it really did seem to be a quite a toxic place with lots of backbiting and gossip and factions and teams and cruelty to people who work for your same employer to whom you owe a duty of basic professionalism. So people seem not to be meeting that basic duty. And I think if you were a man, you would find all of that deeply alienating. Any human being would find that deeply alienating. So what that means is if you're in an institution that has become feminized, it's only going to get more feminized as men find it unwelcoming and go away. If we now want to reverse that process, we may have to carve out little islands within psychology or journalism or wherever and say, \"All right, this is going to be a safe space for men to pursue this institution or this field in a masculine way and we're all going to let them do that and it's not going to be >> well.\" One of the things that occurred to me as you were talking is one of the reasons an institution might carry on with this sort of runaway feminization to borrow a term from from climate change debate. Um is is the other point you made earlier which is that like I can easily imagine being a being me in a New York Times editorial room going in my head, well this is all crazy like why are we doing this? But if you feel the way the wind is blowing, you're probably not going to say anything. And so the corrective mechanism that would have existed once, which is guys, guys, what are we doing? That doesn't really exist because disscent is not part of the process. It it's not encouraged and tolerated. It's punished and ostracized. That would sort of explain the runaway dimension of all of this. Right. >> Definitely. >> Okay, that makes sense to me. The the thing that also that I worry and I've been talking about this quite a bit constant is going to >> is your mother from Venezuela. [clears throat] Yes. I used to be a teacher. >> All right. Go on. >> No, it's the kind of the death of the maverick essentially. We used to see you know whether it was in movie making or acting or journalism and all these professions there'd be that be that kind of rebel voice which was kind of accepted and tolerated within the industry because they'd be like I mean he's kind of and it all frequently was a he I mean he's kind of kooky but sometimes you know he'll say things or do things you'll be like wow that is genuinely brilliant and he's the only one capable of that because he's got this you know quirk individualistic rebel type mindset. And my concern is with the feminization, if it's true, and I believe it is, which values homogeneity, you're going to eliminate those voices. And those voices or personalities are very frequently the people who drive an industry forward because they're the ones who innovate. >> And it's so hard to quantify that, right? So when people come to me and say, \"What have been the negative effects of the great feminization?\" that I think is at the very top of my list. That's one of the most important ones that if you've got HR ladies planted in every single institution and who see it as their mission to get rid of exactly that maverick [clears throat] type of personality, there's so much innovation that we're missing out on, but we don't know what would have been. One of the cancellations that affected me very emotionally, very deeply was I can't remember the guy's name, but he was the astronomer or astrophysicist who had just like landed a satellite on a comet or something really impressive like that, but he was wearing the t-shirt with the scantily clad ladies on it. It was like a bowling t-shirt. I remember this. >> Yeah. And somebody said, \"Oh, no. He's got scantily clad women on his t-shirt.\" And they put him through a struggle session for disrespecting women. And I was thinking, this guy just landed a satellite on a comet. Focus on that. He's so impressive. And you're putting him through this horrible public shaming, but that's that's the way wokeness works. It it doesn't even register to these people that this guy has done something deeply scientifically impressive. That he might be a singular human being. For all you know, he might be the only person on the planet who could have done that. And all you care about is the shirt he's wearing. >> You might phrase it as it's not missiondriven, it's process driven. >> Yes. And I if you take away the male and female out of this entirely, if you look at industries, departments, government departments, etc., if you think about so we, you know, we run a small business, which is what our podcast is, we only care about one thing. That's the results. That's the mission. If we cared more about the process, I can immediately tell you that would make a worse product. But but it's natural. It's it's the end. Of course, it would. If you focus on the mission, you're probably going to do everything towards the mission. If you focus on the process, the mission is secondary by nature. So, I guess what you're saying is we've kind of gone a little bit too far in the process direction. Well, there's a reason why you tend to see women under reppresented at startups because startups of all the kinds of institutions in the world tend to be the most missiondriven. They're all focused on just one thing, getting this company up off the ground. um you start to you start to see more female employees when it becomes a bigger institution that has an HR department and more staff and things like that. Um women tend to thrive in that. But when it's just five guys in a garage, as a matter of simple demographics and and observation, we observe that there are fewer women in companies of that kind. >> All right, Helen, one thanks to you. We're not hiring any more women. [laughter] >> It's just white men from here on in. >> Yeah, that's it. It's all about the mission. The mission is to keep a male. Um Helen, it's been great talking to you. Thank you for coming on. It's very interesting perspective. Uh we're going to go to uh Substack where our audience going to get ask you their questions. But before we do, we always end with the same question in our main interview, which is what's the one thing we're not talking about as a society that we really should be. >> Falling birth rate. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. We've talked about that a lot on this show, but I totally agree with you. >> Other other people >> other people, >> less enlightened people. >> Less enlightened people need to talk more about that. Thank you so much for coming on. Head on over to triggerpod.co.uk where we're going to ask Helen your questions. How do we let women have the same or similar opportunities as men without them being required to abandon their femininity? And how do we let men have the same opportunities as women without them being required to abandon their masculinity? [music]"
