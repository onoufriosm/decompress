# Launch Plan

## Strategy
Targeted outreach first. Get 50 paying users before going loud.

## Week 1: 50 DMs in 3 Days

**Day 1**: Find 25 people, send 25 DMs
**Day 2**: Send 25 more, reply to responses
**Day 3**: Follow up, onboard signups

### DM Template

```
Hey [name] - I built a tool that sends daily email summaries of tech podcasts (a16z, All-In, 20VC, etc). 5-minute reads instead of 2-hour watches.

Thought it might be useful given you [specific reason].

### Expected Results
- 50 DMs → 10-15 replies → 5-10 trials → **2-5 paying users**

- Once you find one good person, check who they follow

### Filter Criteria
| Check | Why |
|-------|-----|
| 1K-50K followers | Big enough to be real, small enough to read DMs |
| Bio mentions work | "founder", "investor", "building", "PM at..." |
| Tweeted in last week | Active, will see your DM |
| Not a podcast host | They make content, don't consume it |
