# Plan: Find 20 More DM Candidates (51-70) for dm3-candidates.md

## Context
We have 50 candidates in dm-candidates.md / dm2-candidates.md. We need 20 more (candidates 51-70) stored in `dm3-candidates.md` with the same format: full candidate info + DM below the 2026 activity line.

## Key Rules
- **Avoid podcast hosts** — focus on podcast LISTENERS who are founders/operators/product leaders
- **Check envelope icon** — if DMs are open, write a DM. If not, write a Post Reply for strong matches, or SKIP
- **DM style** — first name, reference specific tweet, genuine curiosity question, no pitch, no product mention, 2 lines max
- **Qualification**: Must be a founder/operator/product leader who actively reflects on podcast content, not just retweets. Must have 2026 activity.

## Target Podcasts (X handles to verify first)

| Podcast | X Handle (best guess) | Verify? |
|---------|----------------------|---------|
| 20 VC | @HarryStebbings / @20VCFund | Yes |
| a16z | @a16z | No |
| Lenny's Podcast | @lennysan | No |
| All-In Podcast | @theallinpod | Yes |
| Hard Fork | @kevinroose / @CaseyNewton | Yes |
| Uncapped | unknown | Yes |
| Alex Kantrowitz | @Kantrowitz | Yes |
| Nikhil Kamath | search needed | Yes |
| Stripe | @stripe | No |
| No Priors | @NoPriorsPod | Yes |
| Dwarkesh Patel | @dwarkesh | Yes |
| Sequoia Capital | @sequoia | No |
| BG2 | @bg2pod | Yes |
| This Week in Startups | @TWiStartups / @Jason | Yes |
| Acquired | @AcquiredFM | No |
| Lex Fridman | @lexfridman | No |
| TBPN | unknown | Yes |
| First Round | @firstround | Yes |
| Invest Like The Best | @patrick_oshag | Yes |

## Execution Steps

### Step 1 — Verify X handles
Search X for each podcast marked "Yes" to confirm the correct handle.

### Step 2 — Search for listeners (cycle through all 19 podcasts)
For each podcast, run 1-2 searches:
- `@[x_handle] since:2026-01-15 -filter:replies` (Latest tab)
- `"[podcast name]" episode since:2026-01-15` (if handle search is thin)

Target ~1-2 candidates per podcast to reach 20 total.

### Step 3 — Qualify each candidate
1. Open profile → check bio (founder/operator/product leader? NOT a podcast host?)
2. Verify 2026 activity
3. Check if envelope icon (DMs open)
4. Save to dm3-candidates.md with DM or Post Reply or SKIP

### Step 4 — People tab searches (backup if needed)
- `podcast founder building` (People tab)
- `podcast CEO product` (People tab)

## Output
- `marketing/dm3-candidates.md` with candidates 51-70
- Same format as dm2-candidates.md
