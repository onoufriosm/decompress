You are helping me find early users for a new product.

Use the Chrome connection to search X (Twitter) and identify 30–50 high-signal profiles of founders or operators who actively listen to business or tech podcasts.

Target persona:
- Founders, operators, or product leaders
- Actively reflect on podcasts they listen to
- Podcasts include: Acquired, All-In, Lenny’s Podcast, BG2, Lex (business/tech episodes)

How to search:
1. Run multiple X searches using phrases like:
   - "just listened to Acquired"
   - "great episode" "All-In"
   - "key takeaway" podcast
   - "finished listening to" podcast
2. Focus on original tweets, not retweets.
3. Open profiles and qualify them.

Qualification criteria:
- Mentions startups, product, investing, or operating
- Writes thoughtful or reflective posts (not memes or promo-only)
- Appears to genuinely listen to and think about podcast content

For each qualified profile, extract:
- Name / handle
- Profile URL
- Which podcast they mentioned
- The exact tweet or a short paraphrase
- Why they seem like a good early user for a podcast summarization / digest product
